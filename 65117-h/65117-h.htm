DAVISON</p>
</div>


<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>



<p><span class="smcap">A roomy</span>, comfortable, old-fashioned house in Bayswater,
with high windows, big rooms, and little balconies
just big enough to hold a wealth of flowers
in summer and a very pretty show of evergreens when
the season for flowers was past.</p>

<p>On October a row of asters, backed up by a taller
row of foliage plants, made the house look bright
and pretty, and the young faces that appeared at the
windows of the drawing-room made it prettier still.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Aldington, the occupiers of the
house, thought that there was nothing pleasanter in
life than the gayety of young people, and so, as they
had only two children, a son and a daughter, both
grown up, they gave a general invitation to the
younger generation, of which, particularly on a Sunday
afternoon and evening, the contemporaries of
their son and daughter were not slow to avail themselves.</p>

<p>Especially was it the pleasure of these good-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
people to extend hospitality to those young
folks whose lives were, for one reason or another,
not so bright as those of their own children. And
many a friendless young barrister waiting for a brief,
young doctor struggling for a practice, and many a
girl whose parents had a hard time of it in keeping
up a fair position on an unfairly small income, found
recreation and a warm welcome at the old-fashioned
house in Bayswater.</p>

<p>Some of them found more than that. Gerard
Buckland, for instance, a clever young barrister who
was tired of hearing of the great things he was to do
some day, since he was unable to get even small
things to do to go on with, found at the Aldingtons
something that he had stoutly resolved to do without
until he had &#8220;got on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found, in other words, his &#8220;ideal.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was on a bright Sunday afternoon, when the
big drawing-room was full of lively people, mostly
young, and all talking at once, that Gerard, having
been introduced by Arthur Aldington two Sundays
previously, took advantage for the third time of the
general invitation given him by the host and hostess,
and found himself surrounded by a dozen people
among whom he knew no one except the Aldingtons
themselves.</p>

<p>Whereupon Rose, the daughter of the house, made
him sit by her, and, as he was shyly looking over a
basketful of loose photographs which he had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
on a table beside him, undertook the task of showman,
and told him all about the pictures as he looked at
them one by one.</p>

<p>It chanced that the second picture he picked
up after Rose&#8217;s arrival was the portrait of a girl
which attracted him at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an interesting face!&#8221; said he, as he looked
at the photograph.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s an interesting girl too!&#8221; said Rose,
who was a plain, amiable young woman of six-and-twenty,
whom everybody liked and nobody had as yet
chosen. &#8220;She&#8217;s the daughter of a Colonel, who
speculated, and then died and left his wife and two
girls with scarcely anything to live upon. Papa
says it&#8217;s one of the saddest stories he knows. They&#8217;ve
gone to live in a cottage somewhere, after living in
one of the most beautiful houses you ever saw in the
country, and having a flat in town as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard Buckland was looking intently at the photograph,
which was that of a quite young woman
with an oval face, delicate features, and an expression
which combined vivacity with intelligence.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks very clever,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so she is&mdash;and very pretty too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very, very pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was fascinated; and when he was compelled to
look at other photographs, he placed that of the girl
whose story he had just heard at the side of the basket,
in such a position that he could glance at it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
again from time to time, and amuse himself by speculating
about this girl who was so handsome, so clever,
and so unlucky.</p>

<p>Rose Aldington noticed his preoccupation with the
picture, and said, with a smile&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you admire her, just as everyone else
does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking the story a sad one,&#8221; said Gerard,
rather confused at being discovered in his act of
adoration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, perhaps she&#8217;ll marry well, and her sister
too, and then it will be all right. The sister is
even better-looking than Ra&mdash;than she is, and just
as nice. Only unluckily she hadn&#8217;t finished growing
up when their father died, so she hasn&#8217;t had the benefit
of such a good education as the elder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard upon a girl, though, when she has to
marry just for money,&#8221; observed Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course. And I&#8217;m not sure that this
particular girl would do it either. But that&#8217;s the
usual thing to say, isn&#8217;t it, when a very pretty girl
is left unexpectedly poor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard answered quite shortly, and looked at the
photograph again. And at that moment the door
opened, and an exclamation rose to his lips as he recognized
in the new arrival the very girl whose picture
he held in his hand.</p>

<p>He felt the blood rush to his face as he looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
her. He saw at once that the absence of color from
the photograph had given him an altogether wrong
impression of what the girl herself would be like.
She was of medium height, slender, pale, brown-haired,
brown-eyed, and her dress was plain almost to
dowdiness.</p>

<p>But she carried herself so well, her figure was so
graceful, her expression so intelligent, and her smile
so charming, that she attracted instinctive attention
in greater measure than any of the other girls in the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel!&#8221; cried Mrs. Aldington.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison!&#8221; cried her son Arthur at the same
moment.</p>

<p>And the new-comer was brought into the group
near the fire and surrounded, while Gerard Buckland,
at a little distance, listened to the tones of her
voice, and approved of them as he had done of every
detail concerning her.</p>

<p>Only one thing about her seemed amiss. Well
as she wore her plain, almost shabby clothes, neat
and graceful as she looked in them, Gerard felt that
they were not the clothes which she ought to be wearing,
that her beauty demanded a better setting than
the plain serge skirt, the black jacket, the gray felt
mushroom hat with its trimming of a quill and a big
black rosette, which, though they became her, were
not quite smart enough either for the occasion or
for her own type of womanhood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Gerard saw the glance of Rose Aldington wander
in his direction with a sly look, and he hoped she
would not forget to find an opportunity to introduce
him to the interesting guest.</p>

<p>He was not disappointed. Before tea was brought
in, Rose had contrived the introduction, and Gerard
found himself in conversation with the girl whom he
felt to be the nearest he had yet met to the sort of
floating ideal of what is most gracious in woman,
which he, in common with most young men, carried
about in his mind, ready to crystallize into the
face and form of some human, breathing, living
girl.</p>

<p>As she interested him, so did he, perhaps, interest
her. The tall, shy, handsome fair man of five-and-twenty,
who spoke so softly, but who looked as if his
voice could be heard in other and stronger tones upon
occasion, and of whom it had been whispered in her
ear by Rose that he was &#8220;so clever, bound to make a
name for himself at the bar,&#8221; was pleasant to look
upon and to listen to, and the two young people, in
that pleasant twilight which Mrs. Aldington loved,
and which she would not too soon have broken in
upon by gas and candles, soon began to find that
they had many things to say to each other, as they
sipped tea and nibbled cake, to the accompaniment of
the other gay young voices, in the illumination of the
leaping firelight.</p>

<p>Somebody had drawn the talk of the whole room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
into the old channel of woman&#8217;s rights and position,
and immediately the whole company had broken up
into interested little couples and groups to discuss it
with the same freshness of interest as if it had never
been discussed before.</p>

<p>Rachel Davison was rather bitter about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well to talk,&#8221; she said, &#8220;about the
right of woman to act for herself, and to make a
position for herself, and the rest of it. But you
want more than the right: you must have the power.
And that is what we shall never get,&#8221; she added, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>Gerard argued with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t they have the power?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;When once the barriers of prejudice are pulled
down, what&#8217;s to prevent a woman from entering any
field where she feels her talents will be best employed?&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;When once the barriers of prejudice are broken
down!&#8221; echoed she. &#8220;But that will be never. You
don&#8217;t recognize how strong they are! Why, look
at my mother, for instance; she&#8217;s more particular
about little things, prejudices and that sort of thing,
than about important ones. And she&#8217;s not alone,
she&#8217;s one of a type, the most common type. She
would rather see her daughters dead, I&#8217;m quite sure,
than engaged in any occupation which she&#8217;s been accustomed
to think unwomanly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;But she belongs to the last generation. We go
on enlarging our ideas. You, for instance, don&#8217;t
agree with her, I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in everything, certainly; though I agree
with her enough to sympathize with her, and to wish
that the world were just as she sees it, with plenty of
work for all, and work of the pleasantest kind&mdash;work
that one could engage in without loss of dignity,
and with credit to oneself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of such work to be found now.
What about the dignity of labor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All very well in theory, but quite a mistake in
practice. At any rate, there&#8217;s nothing dignified
about any calling which I, for example, could find to
follow. Now poor mamma thinks it&#8217;s all right, that
one has only to look about to find ways of utilizing
what she calls one&#8217;s talents, and to make heaps of
money by them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;s right after all. I&#8217;m sure you
wouldn&#8217;t be long in finding an opening for yours, if
you wanted one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you say that? At least I know.
Of course, it&#8217;s the sort of thing a man must say to a
woman. But, as a matter of stern fact, I haven&#8217;t
any talents, and for a woman without to look for remunerative
and dignified labor is just the most appalling
waste of time imaginable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure you have talents, only perhaps
you don&#8217;t recognize them yourself yet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;What makes you speak so certainly, when I tell
you I have not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure whether I dare tell why. The
thing I should have to say, if I were to tell the truth,
is the sort of thing some ladies as young as you don&#8217;t
care to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her with shy interest, and she, alert
and inquisitive, insisted upon his explaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether I like to hear it or not, I must know
what you mean,&#8221; she said, with charming imperiousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, Miss Davison, you look&mdash;may I say
it?&mdash;&#8216;brainy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been told that before, but the look is deceptive.
I&#8217;m only just not quite an idiot. I can&#8217;t
do anything&mdash;except one thing that I don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;ll own to,&#8221; she added, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me put you through a short catechism.
Can&#8217;t you play?&mdash;the piano, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even well enough to get through the accompaniment
of a song at sight, or to play an easy
piece that I haven&#8217;t diligently practiced till the family
is tired to death of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you paint?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I can copy drawing-master&#8217;s pictures,
which are like nothing in heaven or earth or the water
under the earth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;You can sing, I feel sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can, but you have to sit very near the
piano to hear me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have some other accomplishments
which you have concealed from me,&#8221; said Gerard,
affecting a judicial frown.</p>

<p>Miss Davison laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have one, but wild horses shan&#8217;t drag
from me what it is. And, if you knew, you would
not advise me to use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, I must have complete confession.
No half-way measures. Let me see if I can&#8217;t suggest
a way of utilizing this mysterious accomplishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, blushed crimson, and suddenly opening
her hand, showed him, lying flat on the palm,
a little silver pencil-case, at sight of which he uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s mine, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said he. &#8220;How
did you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, she laughed, and Rose Aldington,
who was sitting near, joined in her mirth, which was
of rather a shame-faced kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Showing off again, Rachel?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Miss Davison laughed, gave the pencil-case back
to Gerard, and said, with a demure look&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There! that&#8217;s my best accomplishment. I flatter
myself I can pick pockets with any amateur living.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Now you wouldn&#8217;t recommend me to take to that as a
livelihood, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was amused, almost dismayed, but protested
earnestly that there must be a hundred ways in which
such exceeding dexterity could be profitably exercised
without having recourse to the profession she suggested.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, Rose Aldington having
drawn the attention of the rest of the people in the
room to Rachel&#8217;s accomplishment, she was called
upon to give another exhibition of her skill, and this
she did in various ways, transferring trifles from the
mantelpiece to the table and back again so quickly
and cleverly that the eye could not follow her movements,
and performing other little feats requiring extreme
delicacy of touch and quickness of eye, until
they all told her she would make her fortune if she
were to set up as a conjurer.</p>

<p>Gerard, however, was more deeply interested than
the rest. He learned from her that she performed
these various tricks without ever having been taught
conjuring, and he argued from this that, if she were
only to train her special faculties in some given direction,
she could not fail to become exceedingly expert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you
would make a very clever milliner, with your wonderfully
light touch.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Miss Davison sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I should,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but my mother
won&#8217;t hear of it. Prejudice again! And I daresay
that the talent which seems extraordinary when it is
untrained, would turn out quite commonplace if I
were to be pitted, at any calling such as millinery,
against those who have for years been brought up to
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;Indeed, I&#8217;m
sure you do yourself an injustice. Your lightness
of hand and quickness of eye are quite remarkable.
And the wonderful way in which you move, so that
you get from one place to another without being seen
on the way, if I may so express it, reminds one rather
of a bird than of the average solid, stolid thing we
call a human being.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison was amused, rather pleased, by his
evident enthusiasm, and when he modestly and stammeringly
expressed a hope that she would let him
know if she decided to make any practical use of her
talents, she told him that when she and her mother
came to town, she would ask him to go and see them.</p>

<p>&#8220;At present,&#8221; she added, &#8220;we are living quite in
the country, and we can&#8217;t receive any visitors because
my mother is not well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how shall I know&mdash;through the Aldingtons&mdash;when
you come to town?&#8221; asked Gerard eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; they will know before anyone. Mrs.
Aldington is such a dear, and so is her husband; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
so, for that matter, are Arthur and Rose. Yes,
whenever we come up, and wherever we settle, they
will know our address at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Miss Davison rose to go, Gerard Buckland
was not long in following her. He came up with
her before she reached the corner of the street, and
begged to be allowed to see her to the station.</p>

<p>But she refused, saying quite gently that she must
get used to going about alone, and that it was the
first step towards women&#8217;s rights.</p>

<p>He looked pained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have been so very grateful to you if
you had let me call upon you!&#8221; he said humbly, wistfully.</p>

<p>Her face grew grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I can&#8217;t do that. The plain truth
is that my mother has not yet got over a terrible change
in circumstances which we&#8217;ve suffered not long ago,
and she can&#8217;t bear that anyone should see us in
what is practically a workman&#8217;s cottage. Prejudice
again, of course, but it has to be considered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I hope for the pleasure of meeting you
again at the Aldingtons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m often there. I shall be very pleased
to see you again when I go there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him her hand and he was obliged to bid
her good-bye and leave her.</p>

<p>But the impression she had made upon him was so
strong, deepened, no doubt, by the circumstances in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
which she was placed, and also, perhaps, by her resolute
attitude which was neither coquetry nor prudery,
but simply pride, that he could scarcely think of
anything for the next few days but the pale oval face
and the big brown eyes, alternately gay and grave,
and the soft voice that was different from the voices
of other girls.</p>

<p>He went to the Aldingtons assiduously after that,
always hoping to meet Miss Davison again. But
each time he was disappointed, and at last he grew
ashamed of calling so often, and of being so dull
when he was there, and absented himself for a couple
of months from the old-fashioned Bayswater house
and its gay circle.</p>

<p>Then he called again, but only to hear that nothing
had been seen or heard of the Davisons for some
time. At last, six months after his meeting with Rachel,
and while the remembrance of her face, her
voice, and her quietly outspoken opinions was still
fresh upon him, Gerard met Arthur Aldington one
day in the Strand and was at once reproached for
neglecting them.</p>

<p>Gerard made excuses, and asked after Miss Davison.</p>

<p>Arthur&#8217;s face changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happened to them,&#8221; said he,
with a perplexed look. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen anything of
any of them till a day or two ago. And then&#8221;....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
He checked himself, and said, &#8220;You were
quite gone on Rachel, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admired her immensely,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;I
wanted to see her again, but she wouldn&#8217;t let me call;
said her mother didn&#8217;t like receiving people in a cottage,
after the sort of life she&#8217;d been used to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was all rot,&#8221; said he simply. &#8220;Mrs.
Davison is the most fluffy, gentle old lady in the
world. It was Rachel who was ashamed of their simple
way of living, always Rachel. She twists her
mother and sister round her little finger, and she
could have had the entire population of London to
call if she&#8217;d chosen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard looked hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an odd girl,&#8221; went on Arthur. &#8220;The
other day I met her for the first time for months at
the Stores. I went there to get some things for
mother, and I ran against Rachel. She was beautifully
dressed, looked awfully smart, and seemed
quite confused at meeting me. She didn&#8217;t answer
when I asked her where she was living, but said her
mother was at Brighton and her sister at school in
Richmond. And I asked her why she hadn&#8217;t been
to see us, and she said she had meant to come, but
had been busy. And she promised to come last Sunday,
but she didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she living in town?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; but she&#8217;s doing well, anyhow.
She looked remarkably prosperous. She puzzled me
altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard, whose interest in Rachel Davison had
been revived and strengthened by this meeting, and
these details concerning the girl who had roused
his keen admiration, called next Sunday at the Aldingtons,
but only to be disappointed and still further
puzzled by the accounts he received of Rachel Davison.</p>

<p>For Rose had met her, shopping at Marshall and
Snelgrove&#8217;s, and Rachel, who was exquisitely dressed
and accompanied by a well-dressed but undistinguished-looking
man had cut her dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s married, I suppose, and to some sweep
whom she doesn&#8217;t want to introduce to us,&#8221; suggested
Arthur.</p>

<p>And Gerard&#8217;s spirits ran down to zero at the
thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was two months later than this meeting, and
nearly eight months after his first meeting with Rachel
Davison, when Gerard Buckland, as he was &#8220;doing&#8221;
the Academy with a listless air on a hot afternoon
in June, came suddenly upon a sight which at
once changed his listlessness into excitement of the
most violent kind.</p>

<p>In front of him, with half a dozen Provincial and
suburban loungers in between, were two girls, both
beautifully dressed, of whom Gerard at once recognized
the elder to be Rachel Davison.</p>

<p>The transformation, however, from the plainly
dressed and dowdy girl he had met a few months ago
at the Aldingtons, to the woman in a trained dress
of &eacute;cru lace, with a big brown hat trimmed with long
ostrich plumes shading from palest pink to deepest
crimson, was so amazing, so complete, that he for a
moment doubted whether he had made a mistake.</p>

<p>For the change was not in dress only. The beauty
of the brilliant Rachel was of that type which is
greatly enhanced by handsome dress, and she appeared
ten times more beautiful now than she had
done in the shabby clothes of the year before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The other girl Gerard guessed to be her sister, and
a more charming contrast it would have been impossible
to find than that of the pale dark beauty and the
pink-and-white fair one beside her.</p>

<p>The younger girl was dressed in an ankle-length
skirt of black lace, a blouse to match with elbow
sleeves, and long black kid gloves to meet them.
Her large mushroom hat was black also, and the only
relief to the somber hue besides her golden hair and
brilliant blonde coloring, consisted in a bunch of
sweet peas which was tucked into her dress.</p>

<p>The good looks and smart appearance of the two
girls attracted the attention of the crowd in the
rooms to such a degree that wherever they went the
people followed them, and Gerard had difficulty in
forcing his way through the admiring mob to Rachel&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>The sight of her had confused his thoughts, made
his heart beat fast, and revived, with extra vividness,
the intense interest he had from the first felt in the
girl.</p>

<p>With some diffidence he greeted her, and was relieved
to find that she did not &#8220;cut&#8221; him, but holding
out her hand with a smile, while a little tinge of
pink color appeared in her cheeks, greeted him by
name, thus showing that she had not, as he had
feared, quite forgotten him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been most anxious for the pleasure of meeting
you again, and I&#8217;ve asked the Aldingtons about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
you, but you haven&#8217;t been to see them lately, they
said,&#8221; he stammered, although he felt as he spoke
that it was rather a stupid thing to say.</p>

<p>She blushed a little more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really haven&#8217;t much time for visiting now,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Let me introduce you to my sister Lilian,
Mr. Buckland. She&#8217;s at school at Richmond, but
I&#8217;ve brought her out for a day&#8217;s holiday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are living in town now?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am staying with some friends. My
mother is living down at Brighton, and I divide my
time between them,&#8221; said Miss Davison.</p>

<p>Gerard hesitated. He wanted more than ever to
know all about her, to be able to meet her at her
home, to renew the acquaintance which had delighted
and impressed him so much. But her words seemed
to imply quite clearly that she had no such wish on
her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I had heard&mdash;the Aldingtons thought&#8221;&mdash;he
stammered at last&mdash;&#8220;that you were married.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a marrying girl,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>There was a pause and then he grew bold.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve taken my advice and found an opening
for your talents,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Miss Davison looked alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she said quickly.</p>

<p>It was an awkward question to answer. He could
not tell her that whereas she had been shabby and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
ashamed of being seen in her mother&#8217;s modest home a
few months ago, now she was resplendent in expensive
clothes, and evidently as far removed as possible
from the pinch of poverty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; he said diplomatically, &#8220;that from
what I saw of you I am sure you would not have
failed to find some opening for your energies, and&#8221;
he dared to add, with a sly glance of admiration, &#8220;to
judge by what I see, you have succeeded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blush faded from Miss Davison&#8217;s face and
gave place to a demure and flickering smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had a little luck at last,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s nothing to do with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment an elderly lady of distinguished
appearance, who appeared to be acting as chaperon
to the two girls, came up to them from the seat in
the middle of the room, where she had been doing her
inspection of the pictures&mdash;and the people&mdash;without
fatigue. Miss Davison had to turn to talk to
her, but she did not introduce him. So he fell back
upon the younger sister, who was full of excitement
and happiness over her holiday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you find looking at pictures tiring?&#8221;
asked he, for want of something better to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. You see this is a great treat for me,
to come out with Rachel; so nothing bores me, as it
might anyone who could do this sort of thing whenever
he liked.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;You are very fond of your sister, I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s face beamed with affection as she
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I adore Rachel. She&#8217;s so wonderfully clever
and energetic, and good to us. Do you know that
she has changed everything for mamma and me, by
her cleverness and her hard work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not at all surprised,&#8221; said Gerard heartily.
&#8220;I told her when I met her first that I was sure she
would find some opening for her talents. She said
she had none, but I knew better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No talents! Yes, isn&#8217;t it absurd? That&#8217;s what
she always says,&#8221; cried Lilian merrily. &#8220;A girl who
can make eight hundred a year, without any previous
teaching or training, simply by drawing designs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Gerard, admiring but almost incredulous
at the simplicity of the means.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; pursued Lilian confidently. &#8220;Of course
she has to work very hard, and she has to go about
just where the firm that employs her wants her to go.
But she says she likes it, and certainly they treat her
very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was puzzled. That any firm should pay a
designer eight hundred a year, and want her to travel
about for them seemed strange, he thought. He had
had a vague idea that a designer must go through
a thorough course of training before his talents were
of much practical value; and to learn that a girl who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
had had no experience of such work could, within a
few months, make such a large income was a surprise
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must have to work very hard,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but she finds time to go about and enjoy
herself too. That is the wonderful part of it, and
nobody could do it but Rachel,&#8221; babbled on the
pretty childlike seventeen-year-old sister proudly.
&#8220;Old Lady Jennings, whom she stays with, says she
never sees her with a pencil in her hand when she&#8217;s
at home. But she has a little studio somewhere off
Regent Street&mdash;only she won&#8217;t tell us where, for
fear we should go and disturb her at her work,&#8221;
added the girl ingenuously, &#8220;and when she has anything
important to do, she just shuts herself up there,
and works away for hours. I do wish I were clever
like that!&#8221; she added wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt you&#8217;re clever too, in some other
way,&#8221; almost stammered Gerard, puzzled and confused
by the strange account the simple-hearted
schoolgirl had given him.</p>

<p>He was conscious, even as he talked to the pretty
child, that her sister was watching them with anxiety.
Was Rachel anxious that Lilian should not be so
frank?</p>

<p>Old Lady Jennings, the distinguished-looking
chaperon, seemed to be anxious to have him introduced
to her. But Rachel prevented this, and
contrived, without any appearance of incivility, to dismiss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Gerard within a few moments of the conversation
he had had with her sister.</p>

<p>He was disturbed, ruffled, rendered uneasy, and
vaguely suspicious of he knew not what. But the
impression made upon him by Miss Davison the elder,
was stronger than ever, and he felt that he could not
rest until he had found out more about her, and
fathomed the mystery which appeared to surround
her.</p>

<p>The more he thought about it, the more certain he
felt that the younger sister must be under a misapprehension
with regard to the income earned by her
sister. Either it was much smaller than she supposed,
and Rachel pretended that it was large, in order
that the younger might not feel that she was a
burden, or else Rachel had some other employment,
more remunerative, to eke out her income.</p>

<p>Was she on the stage? Though Gerard knew little
about the theatrical profession except from the
outside, he was vaguely sure that incomes of eight
hundred a year cannot be made there except by actors
and actresses who have some training or experience,
or who have made such a mark for some
special reason or other, that their names must be
known to everybody.</p>

<p>That the girl in whom he felt such a strong interest
would not stoop to anything unworthy he felt
sure. But that he remembered, with an uneasiness
which he could not stay, that singular treatment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
her friends the Aldingtons, for whom she had professed
so much affection, and yet whom she did not
scruple to neglect and even to &#8220;cut,&#8221; without any
apparent reason.</p>

<p>And why would she not let him be introduced to
old Lady Jennings, when the lady herself had evidently
been willing, if not anxious, to know him?
Why did such a young woman choose to wrap her
doings and her whereabouts in a ridiculous mystery,
which could not but be prejudicial both to herself
and her young sister?</p>

<p>The whole thing was puzzling, irritating, and
Gerard could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>He would have liked to think of Rachel Davison as
he had seen her first, and to honor her for her valiant
efforts to restore to her mother and sister the luxurious
atmosphere of their old home, all by her own
hard work.</p>

<p>Now, try as he would to dispel all doubts from his
mind, he could not but feel that there was a mystery
about her which was disquieting. It was true that
this Lady Jennings, with whom she was staying, was
a woman with a high and even conspicuous position
in the world. Not very rich, she was a great connoisseur
and a much sought after hostess, and no
girls on the threshold of life could have a better, a
shrewder, or a more trustworthy friend.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, Rachel had not been candid
or truthful in her statements to him: was it possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
that she was equally lacking in candor to others?</p>

<p>She had told him that her prosperity was due to
&#8220;luck,&#8221; and had expressly stated that it had &#8220;nothing
to do with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now her sister had said frankly that this &#8220;luck&#8221;
was due to her sister&#8217;s talents and hard work.</p>

<p>What did this discrepancy mean?</p>

<p>Gerard worried himself unceasingly about this,
for he could not get the brilliant and beautiful Miss
Davison out of his head. Lilian had said that her
sister had a little studio somewhere near Regent
Street, where she occupied herself with these wonderful
designs which brought her in so handsome an income.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davison, she had said, lived at Brighton, and
Rachel divided her time between her mother and
Lady Jennings, whose address Gerard immediately
set himself to discover.</p>

<p>It was near Sloane Street, a small house, the position
of which suggested a rental quite out of proportion
to its small size.</p>

<p>Gerard took a walk in that direction, and looked
wistfully at the door at which he dared not knock.
He felt himself to be growing even dangerously
sentimental about this girl, and told himself he was
a fool to think of a woman who certainly harbored
no thought of him.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;there was the rub!&mdash;it had seemed to
him, that afternoon at the Academy, that Rachel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
looked at him with a certain expression which suggested
that, so far from having forgotten him, she
retained almost as vivid a remembrance of him as he
did of her. This was not a fancy, it was a fact, and
it completed his subjugation to the tyranny of his
ideal.</p>

<p>He began to haunt the West End, hovering between
Sloane Street and Regent Street until one
evening, when there was a grand dinner-party given,
and a great crowd was assembled in one of the
Squares in the expectation of the arrival of royalty,
he recognized, with a pang of surprise and terror
which almost made him cry out aloud, the face and
figure of Rachel Davison not far away from him.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a shabby skirt and blouse, and
an old, shapeless black hat, but the disguise was ineffectual
for him; he knew her at once, and was about
to approach her, and to address her, when suddenly
he saw her withdraw to the outskirts of the crowd,
followed by a thickset man rather above the middle
height. Gerard, hiding himself with a strange sickness
at his heart, among the crowd, nevertheless
kept watch.</p>

<p>And he saw her hand something bright and glistening
to the man, and then disappear absolutely from
sight.</p>

<p>Gerard staggered out of the crowd, faint as if he
had received a physical wound.</p>

<p>Was Rachel a thief?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> incident happened so quickly, the appearance
and disappearance from Gerard&#8217;s sight of the disguised
Rachel had been so sudden, so rapid, so quiet,
that it seemed as if the whole affair had been a vision,
a dream, anything but solid reality.</p>

<p>Was he mistaken about the identity of the girl?</p>

<p>Gerard began to think he must be. After all, it
was night-time, there was a great crowd of people
about him, pushing and struggling, and it was easy
enough, in such circumstances, to mistake an accidental
likeness for a strong one.</p>

<p>At least, this was what he told himself, desperately
anxious not to be forced to come to the conclusion
that the girl he had just seen acting in such
a strange, and such a suspicious manner, was the beautiful
Rachel Davison who had made so great an impression
upon him, whom he could not forget.</p>

<p>Although, however, he was unable to accept his
own argument that he might have been mistaken as
to the identity of the woman, it was still open to him
to invent reasons why he might have been mistaken
as to what she was doing. He had believed he saw
her hand to a man a glittering ornament which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
looked like diamonds. And the impression had
brought vividly and painfully to his mind the remembrance
of the first occasion of his meeting Rachel,
and of her display of nimbleness with her
fingers.</p>

<p>There came back to his mind with unpleasant
iteration the words she had uttered about her accomplishment
being good for nothing; unless she
meant to pick pockets.</p>

<p>Of course she had uttered them lightly, and of
course he had taken them as a jest. Of course he
knew too that the idea of connecting the brilliant
Miss Davison with the pursuits of a pickpocket was
absurd, revolting, horrible.</p>

<p>He did not even, so he told himself, think the
matter worth a second thought. But he went on
thinking of nothing else, and hurried away to his
rooms in Buckingham Street, oppressed by a sensation
of discomfort and depression, such as he could
not remember having ever experienced before.</p>

<p>He stopped short suddenly as he was walking
quickly along and tried to remember what the man
was like to whom he had seen her hand the glittering
object.</p>

<p>But the whole episode had passed so swiftly, his
own attention had been so completely absorbed in
the girl herself and in what she was doing, that he
had had no time or attention left for the man. He
remembered vaguely that the man&#8217;s back was turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
to him, that he was tall and broad-shouldered and
that he wore a dark overcoat, but he could recall no
more details, try as he would.</p>

<p>The man, too, appeared to have been an expert at
rapid disappearance, for when Gerard had turned
to look for him he was gone.</p>

<p>Supposing that Miss Davison, being a designer
and therefore an artist, had been in the habit of disguising
herself in order to be able to move about
freely, and to see more of the world and of life than
she could in her own proper person. Surely there
was a possibility of that! There had been instances
before of great artists passing themselves off as people
of a lower station, in order to gain information.
And, now he thought of it, it seemed to him highly
probable, and not merely possible, that this high-spirited
and clever woman, always active and on the
alert for the means to make money for her family as
well as for herself, should make a practice of disguising
herself in the dress of a poor working-girl, in order
the more readily to pass without attracting comment
among the crowds of London, and perhaps even
to collect facts which she could dress up into attractive
press articles, or into book shape, with the object of
earning a larger income.</p>

<p>The more he considered the matter, the more reasonable
this idea seemed. Her sister had said that
she was a designer. Was it not more than probable
that that was what Rachel called herself, and that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
real occupation was that of a journalist, one of
which her old-fashioned mother would probably have
disapproved if she had been told of it.</p>

<p>The little story grew in his mind until it seemed the
likeliest thing in the world. Rachel, anxious for
something to do, aware of her singular cleverness in
gliding about without attracting too much attention,
had availed herself of the only means at her disposal
of earning a good income, by becoming a journalist;
and, in order to get the sort of first-hand knowledge
of life necessary for her purpose, she habitually went
about disguised as a girl of the poorer classes. Because
she knew her mother would be distressed if she
were to know what profession her daughter followed,
Rachel had given out that she was an artist and designer,
and so got the time she wanted to herself, and
represented herself as having a studio near Regent
Street, in order to account for the hours when she
was occupied collecting information for the editors
who employed her.</p>

<p>The longer he lingered upon this hypothesis, the
more he liked it; but in spite of his arguments, there
lingered at the bottom of his mind a vague fear that
his little story was but a fiction after all.</p>

<p>For what of the glittering thing he had seen her
pass to the man?</p>

<p>And what of the man?</p>

<p>Even if his own fanciful theory were correct Gerard
did not like the intrusion of a man into the story.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
He could not deceive himself about that. There had
been a man in the case, apparently young, for he appeared
to be as active as herself, and&mdash;there had been
that glittering thing which he knew, after all, to be a
diamond.</p>

<p>What had the professional journalist to do with
diamonds? What had she to do with a man?</p>

<p>Gerard resented his own fears, his own doubts, and,
determined to solve the mystery at no matter what
cost, on the following afternoon he dared to call at
Lady Jennings&#8217; house, and to ask boldly for Miss
Davison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison is not here at present, sir,&#8221; said
the footman.</p>

<p>&#8220;She lives here does she not?&#8221; asked Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir, she lives here for the most part.
But she has to spend some time with Mrs. Davison at
Brighton. She&#8217;s been down there for the past three
weeks, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard felt as if he had had a blow. For it was
on the previous night that he had seen, or believed
he saw, Rachel in the crowd, and now he was told
that she was at Brighton!</p>

<p>He was about to retire, very dissatisfied, and without
knowing what step he should take next to solve
the problem which distressed him, when a door opened
into the hall and Lady Jennings, whom he remembered,
having seen her at Burlington House, came
out and asked him to come in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>She was a delightful old lady, with silver-white
hair and keen eyes, who dressed perfectly, and who
was a little queen in her way.</p>

<p>She was gowned in silver-gray satin with that profusion
of rich-toned old lace which every elderly lady
who cares for her appearance should never omit from
her wardrobe. A knot of lace which yet was not a
cap was fastened in her beautiful white hair by two
large-headed amber and gold pins, and the rest of the
jewelry she wore was old-fashioned, but appropriate
and handsome.</p>

<p>She led Gerard into a long room with a dining-table
at one end, and every accessory of a boudoir at
the other. Among her flowers and her canaries, her
fancy-work and her pet dogs she seated herself in a
high arm-chair which seemed specially designed to
show off her handsome, erect figure and clever, sympathetic
face; and then her dark eyes softened as she
turned to her guest and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so your name is Buckland? Tell me, are
you any relation to Sir Joseph Buckland, of the
Norfolk branch of the family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am his grandson,&#8221; answered Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! How singular! And I danced with
him at the ball he gave on the coming of age of his
eldest son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My uncle,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;He&#8217;s dead now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! Jo Buckland dead! Then you are
the heir to the title, surely!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;Yes, but not very much more, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, they tell me you&#8217;re very clever, and
that you&#8217;ll bring back fortune to the old house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; asked Gerard, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;My prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Rachel Davison. She heard it
from the people at whose house she met you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Aldingtons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that was the name. She seemed so much interested
in you that I&#8217;ve been anxious to know you
ever since, especially as I thought you might be related
to my old friends. But Rachel is an odd creature.
She wouldn&#8217;t let me speak to you, and I
thought perhaps she was jealous of my attractions.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the old lady laughed delightfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may well have been,&#8221; said Gerard, smiling.</p>

<p>Lady Jennings looked at him with keen, dark eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel&#8217;s an odd girl,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had her
living with me for some months now, but I can&#8217;t say
I understand her yet, though I pride myself on having
some knowledge of human nature. She&#8217;s singularly
attractive, but eccentric, very eccentric.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Gerard eagerly, &#8220;that&#8217;s just what
I&#8217;ve thought. And that makes her more interesting
than other girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the old lady rather slowly, &#8220;I suppose
it does. But it&#8217;s puzzling sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause for Gerard did not like to ask
direct questions, though he was dying to know in
what way Rachel puzzled her clever old friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>While he was wondering whether he dared put a
discreet interrogation about Rachel and her somewhat
mysterious accomplishments, Lady Jennings
said abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe in the doctrine, belief, theory&mdash;whatever
you like to call it, that every one of us in
this world has his or her double somewhere or
other?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard, scenting the approach of a confession
bearing upon the supposed discovery he had made of
Rachel in an odd disguise, hesitated what to reply.
The old lady nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you do,&#8221; she said solemnly. &#8220;Well, I
never did till lately, when an experience of my own
made me begin to think there was something in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What experience was that?&#8221; asked Gerard, feeling
that he was drawing near to a similar story to
his own.</p>

<p>But Lady Jennings did not immediately answer.
She raised the gold-rimmed double-eyeglass which
she wore dangling in front of her from a long thin
gold chain, and looked at a large portrait of Rachel,
which stood, framed and draped, on a little table near
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A singular face! An unmistakable face!&#8221; said
she, almost under her breath.</p>

<p>Gerard was alert and eager to hear more, but Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Jennings suddenly turned the conversation to another
matter&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have you had your first brief yet?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but not many of them,&#8221; answered Gerard,
rather coolly, disappointed at not having heard more
of what he wanted to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you ever go down to the old place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To my uncle&#8217;s? Oh yes, I go down every autumn
to shoot, and always at Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask your uncle whether he remembers Dorothy
Bellingham, and tell him, if he does, that she has
white hair now, but that she loves Norfolk and the
old Hall as much as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And won&#8217;t you come and see us sometimes?&#8221;
went on the old lady, with an engaging smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m
always pleased to see my friends, and I should like
Sir Joseph&#8217;s grandson to be my friend. I am always
at home from four to six, except on Sundays
and in August and the early months of the year. I
love to have young people about me. And the
young people are an attraction to other young
people, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; she said archly. &#8220;More often
than not you will find Rachel Davison with me.
She&#8217;s a splendid secretary and does most of my correspondence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your secretary, is she?&#8221; asked Gerard eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Not actually, but practically,&#8221; answered Lady
Jennings. &#8220;I offered to take her as my secretary
when she was bemoaning the fact that she could get
no work to do, but the girl was too proud. She
caught eagerly at the idea of staying with me, and
offered to do all my correspondence, but she refused
to accept any salary. Then, luckily, she developed
this unsuspected talent for design, and before many
weeks were over she was able to send money to her
mother, to pay for her sister&#8217;s being sent to a first-rate
school, and to dress as she ought to dress. It&#8217;s
astonishingly clever of her, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most astonishing,&#8221; said Gerard emphatically.</p>

<p>Was it fancy? Or did the old lady look at him
inquisitively, as if anxious to make out what he
really thought?</p>

<p>&#8220;And I never see her at work, that is the marvel.
It&#8217;s true she has a little studio where she draws most
of her designs, and that she does the rest down at
Brighton, when she is staying with her mother.
But it&#8217;s wonderful to me that she can find time for
it, when she is always going about with me or with
other friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is at Brighton now, is she not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s been down there for the last three
weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I know her address? I&#8217;m going down myself
in a day or two, and perhaps I might venture to
call?&#8221; said Gerard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Lady Jennings caught at the suggestion, and at
once seizing a piece of paper from her writing-table,
wrote down on it, with her gold-cased pencil, an
address on the sea-front, where she said that Mrs.
Davison was now living in rooms.</p>

<p>She seemed quite eager to give him the address,
and begged him to call again upon her when he returned
to town, and to tell her how Rachel was, and
her mother, and when the girl proposed to return
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Rachel,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that she&#8217;s a naughty
girl not to answer my letters, and that I am getting
into a dreadful muddle with my own correspondence
for want of her help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard rose, much pleased to have received this
general invitation to call when he liked, but went
away puzzled and vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>Lady Jennings, he thought, was quite anxious for
him to go to Brighton to see Rachel.</p>

<p>What new surprise would he find in store for him
there?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> had made up his mind about the Brighton
expedition even while he was talking to Lady Jennings.
He was full of conflicting thoughts, hopes,
and fears.</p>

<p>On the one hand there was the assurance of a well-known
and clever woman of the world like Lady
Jennings that Rachel Davison was a charming girl,
clever, high-principled, and generous to her family,
amazingly industrious and dutiful to her people, but
amazingly proud as well.</p>

<p>And on the other hand there was the question of
Lady Jennings as to &#8220;doubles,&#8221; which made him
ask himself&mdash;what he had not dared ask her&mdash;whether
she had herself fancied she met Rachel Davison
in a strange disguise. And there was the old
lady&#8217;s statement that Rachel, while at Brighton,
never answered letters, and her evident anxiety for
him to go down there and see for himself what the
girl was doing.</p>

<p>Of course there was nothing so very amazing in
this fact of the disguise, if disguise it was, which he
fancied he had seen Rachel wearing. If, as he had
supposed possible, she went about as a workgirl to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
collect information or knowledge for literary or
artistic work, it might well be that she would not
tell Lady Jennings all the details of what she did in
the way of her professional career.</p>

<p>It seemed, indeed, as far as he could judge, as if
this clever, independent young woman were rather
a puzzle to her own friends, and as if they treated
her with so much respect that they even condescended
to allow her to keep her own secrets. But Gerard
himself felt that he could not be thus content.
Admiring Rachel Davison with an admiration which
grew ever more perilous to his peace of mind as the
mysterious circumstances connected with her made
her more interesting, he felt that the one thing more
important than anything else to him at that time
was the solution of the mystery about her.</p>

<p>And within a few days he was at Brighton, with
the especial object of finding out what he could
about Rachel&#8217;s life while staying with her mother.</p>

<p>It was with a fast-beating heart and an uncomfortable
feeling that he had not come in an honest
capacity, but in the character of a spy, that Gerard
rang the bell of the old-fashioned but substantial
lodging-house on the Brighton sea-front, the address
of which had been given him by Lady Jennings.</p>

<p>He asked the maid who opened the door whether
Miss Davison was at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, not Miss Davison; but Mrs. Davison
is,&#8221; answered the servant at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Gerard decided at once to see Mrs. Davison and
to find out something at least about the mother of
the girl in whom he was so much interested. He had
heard two different accounts of her; the one, from
Rachel, implied that she was a woman of some character,
deeply suffering from the change she had suffered
in circumstances, and the other, from Rose
Aldington, which was quite another kind of person.</p>

<p>He was shown into a sitting-room overlooking the
parade, and there he found a lady not yet past middle
age, with hair scarcely touched with gray,
and so like her elder daughter that it was impossible
to see the one without being reminded of the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davison remembered the name, when Gerard
was announced, and welcoming him with an outstretched
hand, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Buckland, I have heard something about
you from both my daughters, and I am very glad to
make your acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was surprised and much pleased to hear
this, though he wondered in what way he had been
mentioned by the girls. Mrs. Davison, who seemed
a placid, happy-looking woman, and who had laid
down her novel when he came in, and begun to fondle
a white Persian cat who resented the attention after
the manner of his kind, invited him to take a chair
near her, and asked him if he was staying in
Brighton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for a day,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but I was so anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
to make your acquaintance, knowing your two
daughters, as I have the pleasure of doing, that I
thought I would venture to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad you did,&#8221; said Mrs. Davison.
&#8220;To tell you the truth, although I&#8217;m so handsomely
lodged here, through the cleverness and hard work of
my eldest daughter&mdash;which I daresay you know all
about, Mr. Buckland, I&#8217;m rather lonely down here.
You see, although Brighton is near London, it is not
quite the same thing for one&#8217;s friends to take a hansom
or an omnibus to come and see one, as to take
the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. I wonder you didn&#8217;t settle in
London, since you are so much alone,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davison sighed with resignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a fancy of my daughter Rachel&#8217;s,&#8221; she
explained, &#8220;that I should be happier down here by
the sea. But I sometimes think, though I haven&#8217;t
liked to say so, that I would rather have had a tiny
flat somewhere nearer my friends in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke very gently, but it was evident that she
suffered more acutely than she liked to own from her
isolation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you often have your daughters with you,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Gerard, feeling as he asked the
question, uncomfortably like a spy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very often,&#8221; answered the lady in a tone
of mild regret. &#8220;Lilian is at school, and I don&#8217;t
see her except during the holidays. And Rachel lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
with Lady Jennings, as perhaps you know. I
couldn&#8217;t interfere with that arrangement, because,
of course, socially it&#8217;s such a good thing for my girl
to live with a woman who goes about so much as Lady
Jennings does. And through Rachel&#8217;s pride and
energy, she is able to earn her own living and so to
keep her independence, while Lady Jennings is very
grateful for her help and companionship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t Miss Rachel staying with you now?&#8221;
asked Gerard, in a stifled voice, remembering that
Lady Jennings had said the girl had been with her
mother for the past three weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I haven&#8217;t seen anything of her for more
than a month. She&#8217;s with Lady Jennings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard said nothing to this; indeed he felt as if
he could not have spoken to save his life. In spite
of all the fears and doubts which had previously
troubled him concerning Rachel Davison, in spite
of what he had seen with his own eyes and heard with
his own ears, he had never once supposed her capable
of such elaborate and carefully planned deceit as
that of which he now found her to be the author.</p>

<p>For what was this story, as it was now unfolded
to him? Nothing less than a deliberate lie acted
continually and consistently, not only to her mother
but to Lady Jennings?</p>

<p>For the past three weeks each of these two ladies
had supposed Rachel to be living with the other,
and during that time he himself had had what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
now began to think was absolute ocular proof, that
she had been living in London disguised as a workgirl
all the while.</p>

<p>Of course it was true that the hypothesis that she
was engaged in sensational journalism held good still.
It might be that Rachel, knowing neither her mother
nor Lady Jennings would approve of the way in
which she would have to gain actual experience by
living among people of a much lower social rank
than her own, had devised this method of keeping her
experiences a secret from them. But even if this
were true, Gerard felt that it was too daring a step
for a young woman to take without the support and
advice of some older member of her own sex.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;the episode of the flashing ornament
handed to the man!</p>

<p>He wished that he could do one of two things:
either look upon all this that he had heard and seen
concerning Rachel and her adventures as the work of
imagination, or fact distorted by imagination; or
else that he could give up thinking about a girl
who, whatever her strength of mind and her brilliancy
of intellect, was undoubtedly not entirely to be
trusted either in her words or in her conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, of course&mdash;with Lady Jennings,&#8221; he
stammered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davison noticed the absence of mind with
which he answered the next questions she put to
him; and he, perceiving this and anxious not to betray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
what he thought or felt, exerted himself to
reply and to conceal the effect made upon him by her
statement about her daughter.</p>

<p>But then she put a most disconcerting question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Lady Jennings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, slightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have met Rachel at her house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Miss Davison was not there when I called.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about a week ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see any of her drawings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no,&#8221; answered Gerard nervously, knowing as
he did that these same drawings appeared never to
have been seen by mortal eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s most extraordinary,&#8221; prattled on Mrs. Davison,
who was evidently, poor lady, delighted to have
someone to break the monotony of the life which
her daughter obliged her to lead, &#8220;that Rachel
should have developed a talent for design, for there
has never been any sort of artistic ability in the
family, on either side. But I suppose when a girl is
very clever, like my Rachel, her talent develops in
any direction where it is most wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this theory Gerard could only make a somewhat
vague reply, and Mrs. Davison laughed a little
and apologized for talking about nothing but her
children.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; went on the simple-hearted lady with feeling,
&#8220;really the way in which my daughter has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
changed everything for us by her own strong will
and her own exertions, is to me a marvel which shuts
out everything else from my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He congratulated her, and had tea with her, and
enjoyed the society of the simple old gentle-woman,
with a strange undefined hope in his mind all the
while that Rachel, the brilliant, the puzzling, the
mysterious, would some day develop upon the same
lines, if with greater breadth of view and intelligence,
as this kindly and feminine personality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davison let him go with evident regret and
begged him to call on Lady Jennings and to give
Rachel her love.</p>

<p>Gerard received this tender message with a pang.
It seemed to him to argue more mystery, and more
undesirable secrecy, about Rachel&#8217;s mode of life, that
her mother should not dare to go up to London to
see her elder daughter, but should confide her messages
to a chance visitor.</p>

<p>He went back to town uneasier than ever about
the girl whom, in spite of all that he had learned,
he began to think that he admired more than
ever.</p>

<p>He had discovered beyond a doubt that she was
capable of elaborate deceit, that she was pursuing
some calling of which her relations and friends knew
nothing; and yet, while he remembered the incident
of the flashing ornament, and the further incident
of the unknown man, he felt that he could not give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
her up, that he must find her out and know the truth
about her.</p>

<p>It was a few days after his visit to Brighton, and
while he was debating how soon he might venture
to call again upon Lady Jennings, and whether he
should find Rachel there if he did, when he saw, one
afternoon in Bond Street, a victoria waiting outside
a shop. Leaning back in it was a beautifully dressed
woman whom he recognized, even before he got near
enough to see her face, as Rachel Davison.</p>

<p>She was dressed in &eacute;cru-colored lace over pale pink,
and her sunshade matched her gown. A hat of pale
pink with &eacute;cru-colored outstanding feathers completed
an elaborate and handsome toilet.</p>

<p>Gerard was suddenly convinced, as he had not
been before, that it was she, and no other, whom he
had met, in the shabby frock and battered hat, that
night in the crowd. He went up to the side of the
carriage and raised his hat, feeling, as he did so, as
if the excitement and the suspicions he felt must be
discernible in his looks.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that she looked startled on seeing
him, and that her manner was rather more reserved
and distant than there appeared to be any reason
for. He was sure that she had not recognized him
that night in the crowd; and the only thing he could
think of to account for her coolness was that perhaps
her mother had spoken or written to her about
his call, and Lady Jennings about his visit to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
so that the girl had begun to wonder whether he was
playing the spy upon her movements.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as he greeted her and she bowed
to him, not holding out her hand, that she looked
paler than ever. Her natural complexion was colorless,
a fact which added, in his eyes, to her exquisite
charm and air of extreme refinement. But now he
thought it was almost ghastly; and though he told
himself that this might be due either to the effect of
the pink dress she wore, or to the effect of the
season&#8217;s gayeties and other exertions, he asked himself
whether it was not more probably the result of
intense nervous strain.</p>

<p>The elaborate deceit of the life she led, whatever
her motives might be, must, he thought, be exhausting
and depressing even to the most splendid vitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen anything of the Aldingtons
lately?&#8221; he asked, by way of something to say which
should lead to no awkwardness in replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing whatever. I am so busy that I really
haven&#8217;t time to go and see them, and I don&#8217;t know
what I shall say when I do to excuse myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will take any excuse, rather than not have
the pleasure of seeing you,&#8221; suggested Gerard.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that would be their feeling, as it would be
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shall be going away in a week or two,
and I shan&#8217;t be able to get to Bayswater before then,
I&#8217;m quite sure. Besides, I fancy they always go up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the river in the summer, and shut up the London
house altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been in town all the season?&#8221; asked
Gerard.</p>

<p>And against his will he felt that there was a look
in his face, a tone in his voice, which betrayed more
than he wished her to know.</p>

<p>She looked startled, as she had done on first meeting
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had to go down and see my mother, and
I&#8217;ve been to Richmond to see my sister,&#8221; she answered
rather shortly. &#8220;And you, have you been away
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was at Brighton last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brighton?&#8221; She glanced at him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I called upon Mrs. Davison, in the hope of seeing
you, Miss Rachel,&#8221; said he boldly. &#8220;I had previously
called at Lady Jennings&#8217; house&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I heard,&#8221; cut in Miss Davison with a frown.
&#8220;I was rather surprised to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard, determined to go through with the business
now that he had made the plunge, summoned
all his courage, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you were not angry with me for calling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221; asked Miss Davison
sharply.</p>

<p>Once more he gathered together all his courage,
and replied more boldly than before, as he came a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
step nearer and put his hand on the side of the
victoria.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it because I had been tantalized by one
meeting with you, and I could not wait patiently till
chance put me in the way of another. I therefore
called, first on Lady Jennings and then at Mrs. Davison&#8217;s,
in the hope of seeing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison seemed alarmed, he thought, though
she laughed lightly, and affected to be rather
amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;To look for such a busy, hardworked creature
as I am, in any particular spot, is rather a hopeless
task,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have been so overworked lately
that I have had to threaten to take a long holiday
if I am not allowed a little more relaxation.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated and then said quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s asking too much to beg you to
let me call at your studio and see these designs which
have made so great a mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great deal too much,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I never
let anyone see me at my work. Indeed, having to
get through it in a totally inadequate time, on account
of social engagements I won&#8217;t and can&#8217;t give
up, I couldn&#8217;t do it unless I made it a rule that I
should be left uninterrupted. Even my own friends
are not allowed to visit me in my professional den.
I&#8217;m an advanced woman, you see, strong-minded, and
all that,&#8221; she added lightly. &#8220;The mere feminine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
holder of a latch-key is a slave compared to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gerard, who saw that she kept looking at the
draper&#8217;s shop in front of which the victoria was
standing, as if anxious to get rid of him, was not
going to take his dismissal until he had paved the
way for the explanation which he was by this time
determined that she should give him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are waiting for someone?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for Lady Jennings. This is her carriage,
not mine. She is buying something that ought to
have been chosen and paid for in five minutes, but
she has our sex&#8217;s proverbial inability to make up its
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go and look for her, and tell her you&#8217;re
tired of waiting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I could scarcely permit that, since I got
out of helping her by saying I was tired&mdash;as indeed
I am&mdash;and that I should like the rest out
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do look as if you wanted rest,&#8221; said Gerard
steadily. &#8220;I am sure you work too hard. Not only
at your social duties, and your designs, but&mdash;in
other ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison&#8217;s pale face flushed suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What other ways?&#8221; she asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do a good deal in the way of journalism, I
think,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I? How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember the night of the f&ecirc;te at Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Chislehurst&#8217;s, when the king and queen were expected?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison did not reply in words. But she
changed her attitude, and sitting upright, bowed her
head as a sign to him to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a tremendous crowd outside, and I
saw you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows incredulously. If she was
surprised and disturbed, as he believed, she concealed
her feelings perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw me&mdash;outside&mdash;in a crowd of that
sort?&#8221; she said disdainfully.</p>

<p>He nodded with confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not dressed as you are now, and not looking
as you do now. You were well disguised for your
purpose&mdash;of journalism&mdash;in a hat and coat which
would make you laugh if you were to see them on
the stage, for instance. I thought the disguise very
clever, but I remembered your face too well to be
mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were mistaken, though,&#8221; retorted Miss Davison
with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>But he stuck to his guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;I watched you
for some time. I&mdash;I watched you till&mdash;till you
gave something to&mdash;someone else&mdash;a man, and
then disappeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he had had doubts before, he had none then.
Miss Davison said nothing, but she sat so still, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
such a fixed look of terror and dismay upon her
handsome face, that he was smitten to the heart, and
felt himself a brute to have tortured her, even though
the knowledge of what he had seen could not be
kept to himself, and though it was the greatest kindness
he could do her to confide it in the first place
to her ears.</p>

<p>It seemed quite a long time before she spoke.
Then she turned to him sharply, and said in a voice
which sounded hard, metallic, unlike her own&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made a most curious, a most unaccountable
mistake. You have left me quite dumb.
I don&#8217;t know what to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and then asked in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I tell what I saw to Lady Jennings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake&mdash;no,&#8221; cried she hoarsely.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a long pause when this exclamation escaped
the lips of Miss Davison.</p>

<p>She sat back, trembling and silent, staring out
before her as if unconscious of the presence of
Gerard Buckland, who, holding the side of the victoria
with fingers which tightened as he stood, looked
into the girl&#8217;s face with agony which he could not
repress. For surely her exclamation was a confession!
If she had no connection with the working-girl
whom he had seen in the crowd on the night of
the f&ecirc;te, why should she mind what he told Lady
Jennings? Yet at his suggestion that he should
speak to the old lady about what he had seen, Rachel
had shown the most helpless terror.</p>

<p>She presently recovered her composure, sat up in
the carriage and smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why I should mind
your telling Lady Jennings whatever you please.
But it is, perhaps, a little disconcerting to be frankly
and candidly disbelieved, and the experience is new
and strange to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard hesitated what to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I want to say to her,&#8221; he said, in a low voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
which he could not keep steady, &#8220;is that I think you
do rash things, and that you want someone to take
care of you, as you are too reckless as to what you do
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison looked at him with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you still persist then,&#8221; said she, &#8220;in believing
that it was I you saw that night in the crowd
opposite Chislehurst House?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard met her eyes fairly and frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure of it,&#8221; he said simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most extraordinary!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>He was annoyed with her for persisting in her pretense
that he was mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am sure,&#8221; he went on stubbornly, &#8220;that
Lady Jennings has an idea that there is something
strange going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison was prepared for this, evidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to answer for all the fancies the
dear old lady takes into her head,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m sorry that you should think it necessary to encourage
her in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could say nothing to this, but drew back,
growing very red. Raising his hat, he was about to
withdraw without another word, when Miss Davison,
suddenly sitting up again, imperiously made an
emphatic gesture of command to him to return.
Then looking him full in the face she said coldly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I object to your trying to make mischief, Mr.
Buckland, between Lady Jennings and me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make mischief, Miss Davison;
I want to get your friends to take more care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was so quiet, so stubborn, that she looked
frightened again. There was something feminine,
helpless about her look and manner when she was
threatened, which touched him and made him sorry
that he had to seem so harsh. But remembering as
he did the reference made by Lady Jennings to the
doctrine of &#8220;doubles,&#8221; he was sure that the old lady
guessed something, and he knew that, at all costs,
he must find out the meaning of what he had seen.</p>

<p>After a short pause, Miss Davison burst into a light
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends, Mr. Buckland, my real friends,&#8221;
she said coolly, &#8220;have a strong impression that I
don&#8217;t need looking after, that I can take care of
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve no doubt you can take all the care
of yourself that a girl can take,&#8221; said he boldly;
&#8220;but that is not enough, Miss Davison, if I may
daresay so, in the case of a lady as beautiful as you
are and as determined to let nothing stand in the way
of carrying out her ambitions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison, who had by this time quite recovered
her outward serenity, laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see what ambition would be served by
standing about in a London crowd in clothes not
one&#8217;s own,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It sounds to me like the act
of a lunatic; but as Lady Jennings considers me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
eccentric already, I have no doubt, if you were to
choose to put the notion into her head, she would
think me quite capable of what you suggest you saw
me do. In that case I should simply have to leave
her house, where I am very comfortable and very
useful to her. For she would certainly worry my
life out, and I would not submit to that from anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard bowed, but he did not promise, as she
wished him to do, to say nothing to Lady Jennings.
There was another short silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you will think me a bore, Miss
Davison, for obtruding upon you so long,&#8221; said he,
in another attempt to get away.</p>

<p>She detained him instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to speak to Lady Jennings&mdash;and&mdash;and
my mother?&#8221; she asked imperiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is nothing in my fancy, what harm is
there in my mentioning to both the ladies the extraordinary
coincidence?&#8221; said he. &#8220;It would prepare
them, at any rate, for other such coincidences&mdash;which
will most certainly arise in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he tried to retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you frighten my poor old mother, and
worry Lady Jennings to death,&#8221; she said imperiously.
&#8220;I must speak to you. I can&#8217;t here of course; but
I must explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Explanation was just what he wanted, and Gerard&#8217;s
heart beat high at the word.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Shall I call&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>She interrupted him by a shake of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How can we talk before
her? Let me see.&#8221; She took out an engagement
book from her carriage pocket, and glanced at it
reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you meet me to-morrow somewhere and
take me to tea?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get Lady Jennings to lend me the victoria
to-morrow, and meet you outside Lyons&#8217; tea room at
four. Will that do?&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with the air of an angry empress, cold,
reserved, with a suggestion of suppressed thunder in
look and voice. Gerard went away in a state of bewilderment
impossible to describe.</p>

<p>Not only was he now quite sure that it was she
whom he had seen in the crowd, but he knew that she
had the strongest possible objection to its being
known that she led a double life. He could not understand
it. If she had been a clever &#8220;sensational&#8221;
journalist, with subjects to work up by actual observation,
as he had at first supposed, there was no
reason in the world why she should not have confessed
the fact to him. Although he was not an
intimate friend of hers, she knew him quite well
enough for an ordinary girl to feel sure that he
could be trusted with a paltry little secret such as
that. It was true that she might naturally prefer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to keep her own counsel to her friends on such a
point: old ladies would certainly feel nervous about
such an undertaking on the part of a handsome
young girl as the passing under a disguise.</p>

<p>But when she was found out, and by a man, surely
common sense ought to have suggested to her that
confession was the only safe course! If she had
told him simply that she wore a disguise in the course
of her professional pursuits, and had begged him to
keep her little secret, she might have been sure of
his delighted acquiescence, and of his satisfaction in
the thought that he knew something about her which
she wished to keep unknown to the world in general.</p>

<p>Considering the high level of her intelligence,
Gerard was greatly surprised and disturbed at her
obstinacy.</p>

<p>But he told himself that she would certainly be
more open on the following day, and that she would
tell him, if not all the truth, at least enough to endeavor
to engage his loyalty in keeping her secret.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of these reflections, Gerard felt that
there was still something ugly about what he had
seen. That passing of the flashing stone to an unknown
man, and then the prompt disappearance of
the two persons! What was he to think of that?
What would she say when he told her, pointblank, as
he meant to do, that that was what he saw?</p>

<p>There was all the time underlying his admiration
for this beautiful, spirited girl, a sickening horror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of what might be in store for him when he should
learn all the truth. It was not, could not be possible
that she was a common thief, that the money she
earned was made by practices of absolute dishonesty.
And yet, the longer he lingered upon the circumstances,
the more he thought about that interview
with Rachel that afternoon, the more he wondered
whether there was something horrible, something dishonorable
about the whole affair.</p>

<p>That she was not a designer or artist he was by
this time quite sure: every circumstance confirmed
him in his opinion. No artist worthy the name can
live long without a pencil in his hand; yet no one appeared
ever to have seen her at this mysterious work
which brought in eight hundred a year!</p>

<p>That notion then he took to be disposed of.</p>

<p>He had suggested to her that she was a journalist,
and if she had been one, common sense would have
made her confess at once and add that she did not
wish the fact generally known.</p>

<p>What then was left? She could not possibly be
on the stage without the knowledge and consent of
either Lady Jennings or her mother.</p>

<p>What other calling was open to her?</p>

<p>She had herself bewailed the fact that women can
do so little, and that so few callings were really open
to them.</p>

<p>Yet here was she, admittedly without training in
any direction, making what must be a good income.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Gerard tormented himself all that day and the next
by these and similar thoughts, all leading in the
same unpleasant and unwelcome direction.</p>

<p>The next day when he was waiting outside the
tea room in Piccadilly, he was in such a state of
morbid excitement and harassed thought, that he
wished he had asked her to put off the appointment,
to give him time to find out, before seeing her again,
what he wanted to know about her mysterious way of
life.</p>

<p>He had not to wait very long, for Rachel, being
used to business appointments, was punctual. He
soon saw Lady Jennings&#8217; victoria driving up, and
saw that Rachel herself, very quietly but well-dressed
in striped black and white silk, with black hat, black
gloves, and a black and white sunshade, was the sole
occupant.</p>

<p>He helped her out of the carriage and saw that she
looked rather flushed, a fact which added to her
beauty, and then he led her into the tea room.</p>

<p>They were early, so they had their choice of a
table, and seated themselves near enough to the little
orchestra for the music to help to cover their conversation,
which they knew was going to be serious.</p>

<p>It was some time, however, before Gerard dared to
broach the subject upon which Miss Davison had
promised to enlighten him.</p>

<p>He could not very well say, &#8220;And now for an explanation!&#8221;
but had to wait her good pleasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Miss Davison, however, seemed to have forgotten
the reason of their meeting. She chatted gaily, ate
buttered scones hungrily, saying that she had been
too hard at work to have any luncheon, and enjoyed
herself in looking about her, which she did with a
certain keenness which was not at all like the casual
glance of the ordinary girl out to tea.</p>

<p>It was not until they had nearly finished tea, and
when there was a short silence, that Gerard dared to
say&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking all night about our meeting
yesterday, and about what you said to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was nervous, agitated. Miss Davison clasped
her hands, and turned to him superbly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>But he would not be silenced like that. Gathering
all his courage, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you promised me an explanation of&mdash;of
what I told you I saw&mdash;that night&mdash;in front
of Lord Chislehurst&#8217;s&mdash;in the crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was that? Tell me exactly what you
did see,&#8221; said she imperiously.</p>

<p>And if she was disturbed she hid the fact very
thoroughly indeed.</p>

<p>He hesitated, and then said steadily&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you&mdash;in a poor sort of dress, with a
large, flopping black hat bent out of shape and with
a feather out of curl that hung over it and shaded
the eyes, standing alone&mdash;or you seemed to be alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
in the crowd. Then I saw you hand something that
flashed&mdash;I think,&#8221; he added, bending forward to
speak low and hurriedly, &#8220;it was diamonds or a diamond&mdash;to
a man, who took it from you. And then
you disappeared, and so did he, so completely that
I did not see a trace of either of you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison listened with an unmoved face.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what,&#8221; she said, when he had finished, as
she put her elbows on the table, still with her hands
laced together, and looked at him with a sort of
scornful challenge, &#8220;did you think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he hesitated. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know what to think, Miss Davison.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled with the same superb scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you,&#8221; she asked majestically, as she looked
at him through her eyelashes with an air of ineffable
contempt, &#8220;think I was a thief?&#8221;</p>

<p>The blood rushed to his cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you ask me such a question?&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; persisted she, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what else
you can mean, if you really saw what you say you
did, and if you put upon it the construction which
anybody else would put.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said,&#8221; he murmured, in a hoarse whisper,
&#8220;that you would explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, &#8220;what do you want me to say?
Do you want me to assure you that I am not a
thief?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;Of course not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to say that it was not I you
saw?&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say that,&#8221; he retorted passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I can, and I do,&#8221; said Rachel slowly.
&#8220;Forgive me, Mr. Buckland, if I&#8217;ve seemed to take
this too lightly, but the truth is that the whole affair
is a desperately serious one for me. That girl has
roused suspicions in more people than one, and will
again, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one you saw&mdash;my &#8216;double&#8217;&mdash;Maud
Smith, as she calls herself, a well-known thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard sat back and looked at her incredulously.
Then he bent forward again, and looking earnestly,
entreatingly into her face, asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that the girl I saw that
night was not you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can answer for that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What should
I be doing in a crowd at that time of night&mdash;and
picking pockets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t say that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you? I think you implied it, though.
You saw this girl pass jewelry to another person.
And then you saw no more of them. Is any other
explanation possible than that they were a couple of
thieves?&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to him callous, horrible, for her to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
his unspoken dread into simple, straightforward
speech. He shrank before her as she did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I thought perhaps I was mistaken, and
that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were not,&#8221; she interrupted sharply.
&#8220;It is the bane of my life, that this girl, who is, I am
sorry to say, a relation of mine&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A relation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A near relation,&#8221; she repeated solemnly. &#8220;I say
it is the greatest trial I have to put up with that she
should go about as she does, and lead the dishonest
career she does, and that the likeness between us should
be so strong that not you only, but two or three more
of my friends have seen her and have thought&mdash;what
you thought,&#8221; she added quickly.</p>

<p>He tried to look as if he believed her, but failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you say her name is Maud Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I said she called herself so. Her real name,
unfortunately, is much more like mine. So far she
has escaped detection and conviction, though often
only by the skin of her teeth. Until she is taken up
and convicted I suppose I shall be exposed constantly
to the same annoyance of having her mistaken for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t it be a great scandal for the family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily. Her real name might not come
out. But even if it did, I think it would be better
than for me to suffer the constant misery of being
mistaken myself for a pickpocket, and by people who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
ought to know me better,&#8221; she ended with a flash of
anger.</p>

<p>Gerard hung his head, but he could not feel very
guilty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The resemblance is indeed extraordinary,&#8221; he
murmured.</p>

<p>She shook her head with a bitter little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you don&#8217;t believe it is only a resemblance,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Then pray what do you think about it?
At least I know. You must believe that I pick
pockets for a livelihood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what other explanation is possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat back again, pained and uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; he burst out suddenly, &#8220;that you
would let me see you and this girl&mdash;side by side.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you don&#8217;t believe what I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frankly, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t believe that a face seen for a few moments&mdash;in a
crowd&mdash;in the darkness&mdash;surmounted
by an old tawdry hat with a bedraggled feather&mdash;was
any other than mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard replied stoutly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no I can&#8217;t. I could believe myself mistaken
with regard to any other person&#8217;s face. I
could think I had let my imagination play tricks with
me; but not with your face.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Why not with mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Their heads were close together, the music was playing,
and there was nobody near enough to hear. So
he blurted out the words which he had that morning
thought it impossible that he should ever say to this
woman who charmed him, but tantalized him at the
same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love a pickpocket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the same thing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t believe your explanation; I can&#8217;t.
But I don&#8217;t believe either that you could be guilty of
anything that was not absolutely honorable and right.
I&#8217;d rather believe that my own senses had betrayed me
than believe one word of anything but good about
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had once begun Gerard found himself
fluent enough. He would rather have expected, if he
had left himself time to expect anything, that Miss
Davison would have affected to scoff at his abrupt
confession, and would have laughed at him and as it
were brushed him from her path with scorn, putting
on airs of indignation that he should dare to make a
sort of accusation against her in one breath, and a
declaration of love to her the next.</p>

<p>But she did nothing of the sort. On the contrary,
he saw her face change, the muscles tremble, the head
bend, and a tear glitter in her eye.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, in a hoarse whisper.
&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;we&#8217;d better go now, I think. Lady&mdash;Lady
Jennings&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not finish her sentence, but rose from her
chair, put out a trembling hand for her sunshade, and
began to walk up the long room.</p>

<p>When they were outside, Gerard, who was surprised
and infinitely distressed at the unexpected effect of
his words upon her, said humbly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you very angry with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Davison.</p>

<p>But her tone belied her words: it was gentle, soft,
womanly, almost tender.</p>

<p>He grew bolder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very angry, I think?&#8221; he suggested, as they
stood in the gathering crowd on the curbstone, neither
quite sure what they were going to do next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m very angry,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You&#8217;ve accused
me of disgraceful things, and then you&#8217;ve
dared&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have I dared?&#8221; ventured he, seeing
that the anger she talked about was of the kind that
usually melts on being challenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let us talk nonsense,&#8221; said Miss Davison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the carriage to meet you here? Or may I
take you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anywhere you want to go to.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;I sent the victoria away,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to meet
Lady Jennings, and I don&#8217;t suppose it will come back
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take you to see pictures, or something.
Do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in her manner, in her tone, had suddenly
made him forget everything in the consciousness that
she was not so indifferent as she pretended. He felt
that the explanation she had promised him having
turned out so unsatisfactorily, he had a right to a
better one, and he thought that, if she would only
be coaxed into spending a little more time in his society,
he should get it.</p>

<p>She hesitated. Then she looked at her watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s five o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We might fill up
the time somehow till seven, when I have to be home to
get ready for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard hailed a hansom, and helped her in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going to?&#8221; asked she.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the park,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The part where the
people aren&#8217;t, and where we can talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bold as the speech was, he had been confident that it
would meet with no challenge.</p>

<p>And it did not.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hansom went quickly through the streets, and
took them, as Gerard had said, to that quiet northern
end of the park where scarcely a breath of the world&#8217;s
life is ever drawn.</p>

<p>They got out and wandered into the little-frequented
paths, by this time destitute even of the children
and nursemaids whom they would have found at
an earlier hour.</p>

<p>Both the young people felt that they were enjoying
a sort of surreptitious picnic, an unconventional,
ridiculous <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> which was all the more pleasant
and all the more exciting from the fact that they
stood each on the defensive towards the other: Rachel
still affecting a haughty indignation at his suspicions;
Gerard humble but unconvinced of the truth of her
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, breaking the silence, &#8220;you told
me you were going to bring me here to talk. What
are we to talk about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Talk about anything, as long as I
can hear you speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t believe what I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;What does that matter?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>

<p>She stopped short and faced him, but there was no
longer any pretense at fierceness in her tone. She
was argumentative, and she was charming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to be disbelieved,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and I&#8217;m
not used to it. I resent it, indeed; for you can&#8217;t respect
a person whom you don&#8217;t believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, you can. I don&#8217;t quite believe something
you told me half an hour ago, but I respect and admire
you more than any woman I ever met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s inconsistent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really respect a woman whom you believe
to be incapable of speaking the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course one couldn&#8217;t. But I don&#8217;t think anything
of the kind about you. I think that you have
told me what is not true, but I take it that you had
your own reasons for doing so, and you are in no way
bound to tell me anything but what you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison seemed surprised and touched by
these words, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think that is very magnanimous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; very silly. If it were any other woman but
you, Miss Davison, I shouldn&#8217;t be such a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your compliments are rather left-handed; don&#8217;t
you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not meant to be compliments at all. I
tell you quite plainly, without any compliment, that
I admire you more than any woman I have ever met,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and that I am ready to accept from you conduct
which I should think dangerous and absurd in anybody
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is my conduct dangerous and absurd? Do
you mean in coming here with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, smiling. &#8220;I mean I think it is dangerous
to go about disguised only just enough to be
recognized easily by people who know you. And absurd
not to confess your little secret at once to me,
who, as you must see for yourself, am much too far
gone to be capable of anything but the most extravagant
rapture at being trusted by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had done with reserve now, and he told her
steadily and straightforwardly his story, in tones
which left no doubt as to the genuineness of his
feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; she said softly, after a pause,
&#8220;to call yourself silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, won&#8217;t you take pity on my feeble intellect
and tell me&mdash;something more?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; she said stubbornly, &#8220;all there is
to tell. If you&#8217;ve inveigled me here in the hope of
getting anything more out of me than I&#8217;ve told you,
you have miscalculated, and you have wasted your
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;I&#8217;m enjoying
myself very much. I can talk to you, I can look at
you, and I&mdash;can ask you things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>She did not ask him what things, but became quiet
and subdued, and occupied with the landscape. He
was seeing her in new circumstances, in a new light,
and the change from talkativeness and brilliancy to a
singular tranquillity interested and delighted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can disbelieve the answers,&#8221; she said
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It doesn&#8217;t follow, as I&#8217;ve told you,
that because I don&#8217;t quite understand one answer
you&#8217;ve given me that I might never understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said believe, not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same thing. If I were to ask you whether you&#8217;d
ever cared for anybody, I might perhaps believe your
answer, if you would give me one?&#8221; he suggested
diffidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t. I haven&#8217;t had time to think
about that sort of thing,&#8221; said Miss Davison, in a
matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? Never?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Word of honor. Of course you can&#8217;t say that.
Or, if you did, I shouldn&#8217;t believe <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I be disbelieved more than you on
such a point?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s one, I think, upon which no man tells
the truth to a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you will ever care for anybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated, and once again that pretty, faint
tinge of pink color came into her cheeks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say,&#8221; she answered, in a dreamy and gentle
tone, &#8220;that it might not be possible. But it would
make no difference. I have laid down a plan of life,
and I mean to keep to it. The sort of sentiment you
mean has no place in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not? Isn&#8217;t there any pleasure in&mdash;the
sort of sentiment I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I daresay there is. In fact,&#8221; and a faint
smile appeared on her face, one of those charming
smiles that flitted over her face from time to time so
lightly that they illuminated the eyes rather than
stretched the muscles of the mouth, &#8220;I may say I&#8217;m
sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why be so stoical?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, because, for one thing, I&#8217;m convinced that
the better I&#8217;m known the less I&#8217;m likely to be loved&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I deny!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon him with pretty scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;What matters your denial?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
<i>know</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what love is&mdash;I must say the
word,&#8221; said he with passion. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to call it
everything else, but the real name must come. I love
you, Rachel, I&#8217;ve told you so, and the more I know
you the more I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, because I take care you shan&#8217;t know me beyond
a certain point; and I never mean to. No.
Let me have my say now,&#8221; she went on, as he tried to
interrupt her. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a bit ungrateful for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
feeling: I don&#8217;t pretend not to be pleased. I am
pleased. I like you, and if I were a different sort of
woman I should find it easy enough to go farther; but
I don&#8217;t mean to. No, no, no;&#8221; and with every repetition
of the word her voice grew firmer. &#8220;Just listen
to me, Mr. Buckland,&#8221; and she looked steadily into his
face. &#8220;If you were to know more, if I were to tell
you all the truth about myself, I&#8217;m satisfied that you
would never feel a spark of anything like sentiment&mdash;the
sort of sentiment we mean&mdash;again. No, look incredulous
if you like; be incredulous if you like. In
fact, I&#8217;d rather you should be incredulous about it;
but it&#8217;s the plain truth all the same. Although we
had a little wrangle this afternoon about something
you fancied you saw, and that I explained in a way
you didn&#8217;t like, it is absolutely true that there is something
to be known about me which would make an
insurmountable barrier between us. Now don&#8217;t think
me hard and unfeeling: I&#8217;m neither the one nor the
other really. But I am other things that the ideal
should not be, and one of those things I&#8217;ll confess to
you. I&#8217;m proud: not rightly proud, but wrongly
proud. And that alone is enough to stand up and divide
us&mdash;forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, and as it were instinctively, she
held out her hand, stretching it to its utmost distance
from her, as if she were warding him off. Something
in her face, her voice, her manner, made the gesture so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
significant that Gerard felt as if he had received a
blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now good-bye,&#8221; said she; &#8220;and I thank you
for having suggested this walk&mdash;and this talk. I
am glad we have had the opportunity of speaking out
frankly. Now, in the future, all will be plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have burst out into an eloquent appeal to
her to be open with him, to tell him what was
troubling her, to take into her whole confidence the
man who loved her, who was ready to give his life for
her; but Miss Davison, with her usual cleverness, had
seen and taken advantage of the approach of a group
of people, foreigners on their way to the Albert Memorial,
to make an effectual barrier against a continuation
of their talk.</p>

<p>She insisted on going with the stream of people,
and he had to follow her, bewildered, distressed, and
silent, until they turned into the high road, when she
made him put her into another hansom, and shaking
hands with him, drove away in the direction of Sloane
Street, with a wholly conventional farewell.</p>

<p>Gerard went home to his rooms, puzzled, distressed,
and perplexed as he had never been before.</p>

<p>Not a bit nearer the solution of the mystery which
surrounded Miss Davison than he had been before.</p>

<p>There was the puzzle, that she could talk to him,
could be frank with him&mdash;up to a certain point, but
that she could keep her own counsel perfectly, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
uncannily, and as it were hold him off while certainly
at the same time keeping him on.</p>

<p>For, mystery or no mystery, he was now more in
love with her than ever.</p>

<p>He made an attempt to see her, by calling at Lady
Jennings&#8217; house, but he saw only the old lady, and
heard that the young one was out.</p>

<p>He haunted the streets looking for a glimpse of
her, but for some time in vain.</p>

<p>But as in London no one can remain untraced for
long, and as Miss Davison, in her own proper person,
was not the sort of woman to remain long unseen, in
the very last days of July he caught sight of her as
she got out of Lady Jennings&#8217; victoria at the door of
one of the big stores.</p>

<p>She was, he thought, more exquisitely dressed than
ever, in the palest blue batiste&mdash;of course he did
not know that it was batiste, he simply called it
&#8220;bluey stuff&#8221;&mdash;with a big hat and belt of deepest
sapphire color. She wore a row of pearls round her
neck, a watch studded with pearls and diamonds on her
breast, and in her hat were pins set with real stones.</p>

<p>He thought she looked the daintiest fairy princess
he had ever seen; and the long cloak which she carried
over her arm, of silk of the sapphire shade lined with
the pale blue, was a garment which even ignorant male
eyes could admire.</p>

<p>He followed her into the stores, but kept at a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
distance, wondering whether she would condescend to
see him, and whether he should get snubbed.</p>

<p>She was buying largely, in one of the most crowded
compartments of the establishment, where real lace
handkerchiefs and dainty and expensive trifles made
of lace were being disposed of at &#8220;sale prices&#8221; which
scarcely seemed so &#8220;alarming&#8221; as they were described
to be.</p>

<p>At last she caught Gerard&#8217;s eye, and he saw her
falter and turn pale as she handled, with a connoisseur&#8217;s
fingers, a beautiful shawl of modern point lace.</p>

<p>He wondered whether she was going to cut him;
but she did not. She was evidently confused at the
sight of him, but she recovered herself, shook hands,
and then, asking him to get her a packet of postcards,
and to meet her outside with them, dismissed
him on what he saw to be an errand invented to get
rid of him.</p>

<p>He was disturbed, perplexed, but that was no new
experience where Miss Davison was concerned. He
went obediently to do her bidding, hoping for a few
minutes&#8217; talk to compensate him for his docility.</p>

<p>But as he went back towards the department where
he had left her, he met one of the employ&eacute;s hurrying
out, saying excitedly under his breath to another&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the commissionaire to go for a policeman.
We&#8217;ve got hold of our swell shop-lifter at last.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> felt sick with alarm. A shop-lifter! Although
he was ashamed of his own fears, they overpowered
him.</p>

<p>He asked himself what right he had to connect the
arrest of a well-known shop-lifter with the presence
of Miss Davison in that particular department of the
stores where the theft appeared to have been detected.
But even as he did so, and tried to think that he ought
to be ashamed of his suspicions, he knew very well that
they were justified; that the episode of the sparkling
ornament passed by Miss Davison (or her &#8220;double&#8221;)
to the man in the crowd on the night of the f&ecirc;te at
Lord Chislehurst&#8217;s suggested inevitably that she was
the person who was now to be arrested for theft.</p>

<p>The thought was horrible. Even though, in this
first moment of surprise and dismay, he had no doubts
about her guilt, he was none the less as much distressed
to think of the disgrace which awaited her as
if she had been one of his own kin.</p>

<p>For the puzzle, the marvel of the situation was that
although he could not help his strong suspicions of
Miss Davison&#8217;s honesty, he knew her to be as pure-souled
as it is possible for a human being to be, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the conviction which had already been forming in his
mind now grew stronger that she must be a kleptomaniac,
and that she stole, if indeed she did steal,
not from criminal intention, but by irresistible instinct.</p>

<p>Of course this supposition did not account for
everything. There were discrepancies in any story
which he could make up to account for the strange
behavior, the glaring inconsistencies of the beautiful
girl who had roused his admiration and inspired
him with an unconquerable passion.</p>

<p>She seemed far too sane and well-balanced a girl
to be subject to mania of any kind, and it seemed to
him extraordinary, if she were really a prey to a disease
so acute and so distressing, that she had not been
put under some sort of restraint, or at least that she
was not constantly shadowed by some companion who
could explain her idiosyncrasy and pay for the things
she stole.</p>

<p>He had heard of such things being done in well-known
cases of this kind, and he felt sure that she
could not have become so expert as she evidently was
without the fact of her tendencies becoming known
to some, at least, of her friends.</p>

<p>But even while he argued thus with himself, hoping
against hope that he could prove to himself that she
was innocent of criminal intent, one circumstance
after another obtruded itself upon his mind, all tending
to confirm the fact that she was too artful, too deliberate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
in her plans, for an innocent victim of instinct.</p>

<p>The sending of her mother to Brighton, for instance,
and the cleverness with which she played off
Mrs. Davison and Lady Jennings, the one against the
other, pretending to the one that she was staying with
the other, when all the while she was absent on some
mysterious and unexplained &#8220;business,&#8221; spoke, not
of innocence, but of a very well developed and keen
instinct for deceit of the most flagrant kind.</p>

<p>And, if her thefts were the result of kleptomania,
where did her income come from? For her appropriation
of other people&#8217;s property to be blameless it
must be proved that she did not profit by it. Whereas
he knew that, without any occupation that could be
traced to her, she made large sums of money!</p>

<p>And she had told him frankly that her character
was not a lovable one, that there was a barrier between
them which could never be passed.</p>

<p>Strange to say, however, it was upon these words
of hers and the manner and tone in which she said
them, that Gerard relied more than anything else for
his own fixed and firm belief in her real innocence.</p>

<p>She was conscious that there was something in her
character and conduct that would be disapproved of,
and that would make an insurmountable obstacle between
her and him. And yet she said this with an
evident belief that she herself was justified in the
course she held. And she was so grave, so sincere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
so entirely sane in manner and look during their talk,
that Gerard had felt convinced that the barrier of
which she spoke was not one of the terrible character
her actions would have led him to suppose.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;what was he to think?</p>

<p>The moment he heard the order given by one of
the shop-walkers to a subordinate, to run for a policeman,
he determined to wait outside to see what was
going to happen.</p>

<p>He did not know what was the customary procedure
on such occasions, but he imagined that a cab
would be called, and that a small party, consisting of
the accused person herself, one or more of the shop-assistants,
and a policeman, would come out by one of
the side-entrances, get in and drive off as quietly as
possible to the nearest police-station, where the
charge would be preferred.</p>

<p>He thought that perhaps, in such a case, he might
be able to be of use, as he could offer to fetch her
friends, and bring the necessary and usual testimony
to her respectability.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, he addressed himself
to another assistant, who had overheard the order
given to fetch the police, and asked him if such occurrences
were common there.</p>

<p>The man seemed reluctant to speak, but said that
they were very rare.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe, however, sir,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that this is
a bad case, and that we have at last succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
catching a woman who has been doing this sort of
thing systematically in the big London stores for a
considerable time past. She dresses splendidly, and
is altogether what we should call a very smart person,
and nobody would suspect her of being a thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard wondered whether he should press forward
and present himself as a friend of the unhappy
woman. But he reflected that this was impossible
until he was absolutely, instead of morally, sure of
her identity, and he had to content himself with his
previously proposed course of conduct.</p>

<p>Before he could carry out his intention, however,
he saw the assistant come back with a policeman; and
both men, amidst the whispers and questions of such
of the customers as noticed the occurrence, passed
hurriedly through one department after another, and
disappeared into a private room into which all the
rest of the persons interested in the affair had retired.</p>

<p>There was great excitement everywhere, which the
assistants in vain tried to allay by assuring the customers
that nothing of any consequence had taken
place.</p>

<p>And in the midst of the excitement, a tall, thin
man, tightly buttoned up in a frock-coat, and wearing
a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles, came quickly into
the stores, and was led into the locked private room
where the shop-lifter had been temporarily imprisoned.</p>

<p>Gerard looked at him, noted his black beard, his
silk hat, his professional manner, and wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
whether he was a doctor called in to pronounce as to
the sanity of the thief.</p>

<p>Then, with a heavy heart, after watching the door
of the private room for a few minutes, the young
man went out into the street. There for a couple of
hours he wandered up and down, without seeing anyone
come out who appeared to have any connection
with the unhappy incident of the afternoon.</p>

<p>He made the circuit of the building, going round
to the back entrances, where nothing unusual appeared
to have disturbed the peace of the neighborhood.
He feared that the party might have gone to
the police-station long since, escaping quietly by some
little-known door in order to avoid attention.</p>

<p>At last the hour for closing the stores arrived, and
the last customer having left, Gerard watched the
doors more keenly than ever, thinking that perhaps
they would have decided not to leave the building
until the customers had left.</p>

<p>Just as the shutters were closing, he saw a lady
step out quickly and make a dash for the four-wheeled
cab that was waiting outside.</p>

<p>Gerard uttered a low cry of surprise and relief.</p>

<p>It was Rachel, and she was alone. He stepped forward
quickly, and saw that she was allowed to come
out by herself, and that there was no one in the cab,
the door of which the commissionaire was holding
open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison!&#8221; cried Gerard, with an air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
triumph, which made her stop short, startled, and
turn quickly to look at him. For a moment she
stood as if not knowing what she was doing, or at
whom she was looking, and he saw that she was not
pale with the healthy pallor of every day, which he
had so often admired, but with a ghastly whiteness
that looked sickly and distressing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said faintly, &#8220;is it you, Mr. Buckland!
Why&mdash;surely&#8221;&mdash;she uttered the words
slowly, pausing between them, as if collecting
thoughts that had gone very far away, and slowly
coming back to the life of every day again&mdash;&#8220;surely&mdash;you&mdash;have
not&mdash;been waiting for me all this
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked scared, and stared into his face as if she
would have penetrated to his inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know what had become of you,&#8221;
he stammered hoarsely. &#8220;I&mdash;I thought you meant
to meet me outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I did. I remember!&#8221; said she. And then,
very sweetly, as if overcome with remorse, she said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m so very, very sorry; but I forgot all about it.
I have spent the whole afternoon, or at least nearly
three hours of it, buying lace and frocks and things,
and trying hats on! I&#8217;m so awfully ashamed of myself.
Do please forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me send away this cab, and take you to tea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
somewhere. You look done up,&#8221; said Gerard, still
speaking as if he hardly knew what he was about.</p>

<p>She hesitated and looked around her stealthily.</p>

<p>Then she said shortly, in a faint voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard gave the cabman a shilling, and hailing a
hansom, helped her in and told the man to drive to
the nearest tea-shop.</p>

<p>Then he jumped in after her, feeling his heart sink.</p>

<p>For the delight and relief of the first moment,
when he had been ready to look upon her appearance
by herself, a free woman, as a sign that she was innocent
and that he had misjudged her, had given place
to a dread that the danger was not over yet, and that
she knew more about the affair of the shop-lifting
than for the moment he had supposed.</p>

<p>They went along in silence, Rachel closing her
eyes as if too tired to talk, and Gerard dumb with fear
and distress, and a kind of desperate pity.</p>

<p>It was quite plain that she had been through a
harassing time, much more distressing and fatiguing
than an afternoon spent in trying on new clothes
could possibly have been. So he left her in peace
until they got out at the tea-shop, and even then he
waited until she was refreshed, and until her natural
pallor had returned to her cheek instead of the unhealthy
flush which had succeeded to the ghastly
whiteness he had at first noticed on meeting her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Then it was she who, noting his eyes fixed upon her
face with stealthy interest, asked him abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you wait for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how long you would be. I&mdash;I
was not sure where you were,&#8221; he began. Then
changing his mind he said suddenly, &#8220;And something
had happened at the stores to interest me&mdash;the shop-lifting.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>But he lost his patience, and said curtly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you must know. Why pretend you don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miss Davison had entirely recovered her self-possession
by this time, and she leaned back in her
chair, played with the glove she had taken off, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that what all the fuss was about? The crowd
and the crush round a private door at the back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all about it,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>And suddenly leaning forward, she looked at him
with an expression in which interest in his narrative
was combined with perfect innocence as to the details
to be related.</p>

<p>Gerard did not know whether to be amazed, disgusted,
or amused. This brazen attitude might either
be considered shocking, perplexing, or simply whimsical,
as one chose to look at it. He looked down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and when he raised his head again, after being lost in
thought for a few moments, he fancied he surprised
upon Miss Davison&#8217;s beautiful face a sort of wistful
look, as if she was sorry and ashamed of the attitude
she had to take up, or at least that was the fancy that
came into his head about it.</p>

<p>He dashed into his narrative abruptly when their
eyes met.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman was caught in the act of stealing something,
I believe,&#8221; he said, keeping his eyes fixed upon
her, but meeting with no shrinking in return; &#8220;and
I learn that she is an old offender. A smartly dressed
woman who goes about to the best shops, and is well-known,
but whom, as I gathered, they&#8217;ve not been able
to catch before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have they caught her now?&#8221; asked Miss Davison
innocently. He stammered and grew red.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&mdash;they seemed to think so,&#8221; he said, in a
voice that was not steady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did it was without knowing that she was a
shop-lifter,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kleptomaniac, they call that sort of woman nowadays,&#8221;
observed Miss Davison lightly. &#8220;She will
get off, depend upon it. Some old doctor will swear
to her being in ill health and not responsible for her
actions. Oh, that&#8217;s what they always say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard remembered the man with the black beard
and the gold-rimmed spectacles, and sat back reflectively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Was Miss Davison merely relating what
had already happened? Had she waited calmly while
they went for a doctor, and had he then examined
her and at once pronounced her as wanting in balance
and not responsible for her actions?</p>

<p>It seemed like it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they say she has done it before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And got off before in the same way, no doubt,&#8221;
said Miss Davison quietly. &#8220;Watch the papers for
the next few days, and you will find nothing about the
case, I&#8217;ll answer for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they tell you so at the stores?&#8221; asked he
dryly, and with emphasis which he did not try to hide.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know by what I have seen before of these cases,&#8221;
she replied evasively. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do any good to
the shops to have these things known, because there&#8217;s
always some sort of doubt thrown upon the case by
the other side and people are led to believe that there&#8217;s
been undue harshness in pressing the charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard listened in confusion. Had she reckoned
upon these things, and so felt sure that she would escape
the disgrace of arrest, trial, and conviction?</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they unduly harsh in this case?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know? These people keep affairs
like that quiet, and a casual customer like myself hears
nothing about it except by chance, unless it gets into
the papers, which, as I tell you, it very seldom does.
London is full of well-dressed thieves, and a good
many of them steal for pleasure, and hoard what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
steal. When they get found out, the usual way of
dealing with them is to make them pay for what they
have robbed the tradesman of, as they can always do
easily enough. I&#8217;m quite sure nobody knows how
much of that sort of thing goes on. It&#8217;s very rarely
you find such a case in the papers, very common to
meet with them outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke simply, as if upon a matter with which
she had nothing to do, but on which she was able to
supply information, and did so because he appeared
interested in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what degree of guilt do you ascribe to
them?&#8221; he asked abruptly. &#8220;Are they conscious
of what they are doing, and aware that they are committing
crime?&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint smile flickered over Miss Davison&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them,&#8221; she answered rather dryly, &#8220;are
very well aware of it, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Presently he
caught a strange glance from Miss Davison; she suddenly
looked at him in a frightened way, as if she
thought her last words had contained a confession,
and was anxious to qualify them. But before she
could speak, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes them do these things then? What
makes an honorable woman who is not in want, stoop
to such meanness, such despicable dishonesty?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with great warmth, his eyes flashing, his
fists clenched. He was torn with conflicting feelings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
perplexity, horror, pity, contempt, and through it all
he wondered whether it could be true, and whether this
lovely woman with the frank face, the straightforward
manner, the noble aims, the steadfast heart, could
really be guilty of the abominable crime of theft.</p>

<p>She hesitated and looked down. In her face there
was a strange expression which he could not understand.
It might be shame alone, or sullen anger, or
fear, or a compound of all three. All he could be
sure of was that it was infinitely painful for him to
watch her, and to know that it was his words which
were inflicting upon her a torture which, whether deserved
or not, was none the less distressing for him to
cause.</p>

<p>For he loved her; in spite of the fears, doubts, certainties
even, which tormented him concerning her,
he was ready to believe impossibilities, to trust her
honesty and truth in spite of everything, to say to
himself that there was no trace of the criminal in her;
and that, if indeed these larcenies could be brought
home to her, as he prayed that they could not be, then
that they were the result of some overpowering impulse
of which she was ashamed, and which the doctor
who was called in by the people at the stores, had been
able to explain and account for.</p>

<p>After a silence which appeared long to both, Miss
Davison raised her head to reply to his questions.
But as she began to speak, her eyes were evidently attracted
by some object behind him, and he perceived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
as she uttered some commonplace words, instead of
saying what he was anxious to hear that she was intent
upon something else and was no longer giving him her
attention.</p>

<p>He saw, indeed, a slight raising of her eyebrows,
which he took to be a sign to some person behind him.
Turning quickly, Gerard was just in time to see a
well-dressed man behind him, in the place to which
her eyes had been directed.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s back was turned. Gerard watched him
in the hope that he would turn round and show his
face; but instead of doing so, the man went straight
out of the shop and disappeared in the crowd outside.</p>

<p>When Gerard turned around again, Miss Davison
was on her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what poor Lady Jennings will say,&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;at my being late for dinner, as I can&#8217;t
help being. I must make all the haste I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you a cab,&#8221; said Gerard rather coldly.</p>

<p>He was, in spite of himself, roused to fresh suspicion
by this apparent collusion between Rachel and
the man who had gone out of the shop. He went out
with her, put her into a passing cab, and, by her direction,
gave the driver Lady Jennings&#8217; address.
There was some reassurance in this, that she was going
back home, and he tried to find comfort in the
fact, saying to himself that if she had been in any
fear of being followed or arrested, she would not have
done this.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>When she had driven away, he was about to continue
his own journey back to his rooms, when a girl
ran out of the tea-shop with a cloak which he recognized
as the handsome one he had admired on Rachel&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lady left this, sir,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>He took it with inward satisfaction, for it afforded
him exactly the excuse he wanted for going to Lady
Jennings&#8217; house, to find out whether Rachel had really
returned there, as she had apparently proposed to do.</p>

<p>He was half ashamed of himself for his mistrust,
well founded as it was, as he got into a hansom and
drove away.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> arrived at Lady Jennings&#8217; house at an
awkward hour, and felt rather diffident as to the sort
of message he should give, as he knew it would be dinner-time,
so that he could not very well ask to see
Rachel, and yet did not like to ask if she were at home
and then give the cloak.</p>

<p>When he got to the house, however, he saw that
there was no light in the dining-room, the window of
which was wide open, but that a lady was sitting in
the room above, which he knew must be the drawing-room.
There was a light in the room, but the lady
was standing between the curtains, looking out.</p>

<p>Puzzled and disturbed, he resolved to ask boldly
whether Miss Davison was at home, and did so, on the
opening of the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the footman in answer to his inquiry,
and he at once proceeded to show Gerard upstairs
into the drawing-room, where the young man
found himself face to face not with Rachel, but her
younger sister, Lilian.</p>

<p>The girl was looking charming, her fair hair, which
she still wore tied with a large bow of ribbon at the
back of the neck and hanging down her back, shone
in the glare of the electric light like gold; while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
simple frock of pale pink cotton and the schoolgirl
black sailor hat with a pale pink ribbon, suited her
girlish face and figure to perfection.</p>

<p>She greeted the visitor with frank pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you again,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I
know how much Rachel likes you, and how kind you
were at the Academy. And you like Rachel, don&#8217;t
you? That is quite reason enough for me to be glad
to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in this speech which made
Gerard&#8217;s heart leap up. &#8220;Rachel likes you.&#8221; He
was sure that there was no deceit, no pretense, about
this charming schoolgirl, that what she said came
naturally to her lips from her own knowledge, and
he was touched and surprised to hear the confidence
with which she spoke. It was almost as if she looked
upon Gerard as a sort of possession of the family, to
be greeted and treated as such.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting here ever so long,&#8221; said she,
with a sigh; &#8220;and I am so glad you&#8217;ve come to talk
to me! Lady Jennings is out, and so is Rachel,
and I&#8217;ve been amusing myself as well as I could with
the papers the man brought me, and with looking out
of the window. But it&#8217;s so dull, and such a shame to
have to waste one&#8217;s time like that when I so seldom
come to town!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they expect you?&#8221; asked Gerard, in surprise.</p>

<p>A sort of hesitancy appeared in the girl&#8217;s manner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;Why no,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Something happened this
morning that seemed odd to Miss Graham&mdash;that&#8217;s
the schoolmistress. A gentleman called to see me, and
asked questions about Rachel, and didn&#8217;t give his
name; and as one of the junior mistresses was coming
up, Miss Graham said I had better come too, and
see Rachel and Lady Jennings about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A horrible fear, of a kind to which he was now getting
used in matters that concerned Rachel Davison,
assailed his heart at these words. Who could the
mysterious gentleman be who had come on such a
strange errand, not to Rachel herself, but to her
younger sister, a mere schoolgirl?</p>

<p>&#8220;You did quite right in coming,&#8221; he said, after
a short pause. &#8220;It does seem an odd sort of thing
to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied she innocently. &#8220;Although he did
not give his name, Miss Graham took it for granted,
from the way he spoke, that he was some relation or
old friend of ours, until he saw me; and then, when
I didn&#8217;t recognize him, and he said merely that he
was an old friend of our father&#8217;s, she began to think
it rather strange. However, I&#8217;m bound to say he was
very nice, and that I was quite glad to see him; and
if Miss Graham hadn&#8217;t thought it odd, I don&#8217;t know
that I should have done so. Why shouldn&#8217;t an old
friend of my father&#8217;s come and see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the strange part of it was his not giving
his name, of course,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so. He looked like a military
man, with his white mustache and way of holding
himself; and most of our old friends are or were in
the army. So I asked him and he said &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and that
he had been in the army some years ago. That was
all. But very likely Rachel will know more about
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard sincerely hoped that Rachel would not have
reason to regret the appearance of the military-looking
man who had been in the army, and would not
give his name. But the strange episode suggested to
his mind that the police were making inquires about
the Davisons, and that the white-mustached gentleman
would prove to be one of their emissaries.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very strange that neither she nor Lady Jennings
should be back to dinner, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s past eight, and they usually dine at
half-past seven, I know; and I&#8217;m so dreadfully hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going back to Richmond to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; replied she merrily; &#8220;because I
should like Lady Jennings to invite me to stay the
night, and to take me to a theatre. But it&#8217;s getting
too late for anything that begins before nine!&#8221; she
added with a sudden change to a dismal look, as she
glanced at the ormolu clock which stood on a bracket
on the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought you&#8217;d be having holidays
now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;at the end of July.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;Yes, we have broken up, and I&#8217;m only staying
on there until Rachel has made up her mind what I&#8217;m
to do during the holidays. Perhaps she and I and
mamma shall all go away together somewhere, but it
depends on Rachel&#8217;s work,&#8221; she added, with a sort of
earnest pride that seemed to Gerard infinitely touching.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very irregular, this work of hers,&#8221; he said,
in a voice which shook in spite of himself.</p>

<p>He wanted to learn what he could, but it seemed
dreadful to have to talk about it to this child, who
rejoiced so openly in her sister&#8217;s cleverness, and had no
thought of harm or of wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, very,&#8221; replied Lilian quickly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the worst part of it, that she never knows what she
will have to do next, and has to be at the beck and
call of the people who employ her. It&#8217;s dreadful to
me,&#8221; she said, with sudden earnestness, &#8220;to have to
know that poor Rachel is making herself a martyr to
me and mamma, and working too hard, much too
hard, just to earn money for us. I do so wish I
could do something to help her; but I have no talent
at all for anything, and can never hope to be anything
but a burden to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; answered Gerard, smiling, &#8220;that
you will really have to look upon yourself in that
light very long! I think I can answer for it that
you&#8217;ll find quite a number of people not merely willing,
but anxious, to take the burden, as you call it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
off your sister&#8217;s shoulders very quickly indeed, when
once you&#8217;re &#8216;out.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that somebody will want to marry
me?&#8221; asked Lilian, with a sort of blushing archness
and shyness combined, which he thought charming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The moment you are &#8216;out&#8217; I prophesy
that you will be snapped up,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>But Lilian&#8217;s fair face clouded again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that coming out will be another
great expense for poor Rachel. She&#8217;s determined
that I shall be presented at Court, and the expense
of that will be horrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was aghast. Timidly, hesitatingly aware
that he was on delicate ground, he ventured to suggest
obstacles.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that if you were
to assure her that you would much rather not be
presented, that it would be a useless sacrifice of
money, if I may say so, she would be persuaded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be waste of money, too,&#8221; said
Lilian, with a long face; &#8220;but she is very determined.
She says all the women of our family have always been
presented, and I must be. But what I say is, that in
that case she ought to be presented first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right. And what did she say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said she was afraid she would not be eligible,
because of having to work for firms in trade. And
that in any case she hadn&#8217;t the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if she isn&#8217;t eligible,&#8221; said Gerard, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
earnestly than ever, &#8220;perhaps it would affect your
position too; and think what a dreadful thing it
would be if the presentation were to be cancelled!
That happens sometimes, when any circumstances
come to the knowledge of the Lord Chamberlain that&mdash;that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He grew confused, and stopped. He knew very
little about Court Presentations, but was conscious
that in the circumstances it would be madness to think
of this one.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s an artist, and not engaged in trade
herself, unless you call selling her designs trade,&#8221;
said the girl rather distantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, yes, of course I know that. But&mdash;but
the Chamberlain&#8217;s distinctions are not at all logical.
The wives of small professional men and stockbrokers
are eligible; and a lot of Americans get in who would
never get presented if they were in a similar position
in England to that which they hold in their own
country; while no actress is eligible, however great her
genius or however noble her character, and even
women of rank lose their rights if they engage in
trade. Altogether, there&#8217;s nothing to be gained by
presentation now that the middle classes go to Court
<i>en masse</i>, and if I were you I would very strongly
urge your sister not to persist in her plan for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were talking so earnestly, the girl impressed
by his tones, and he excited by his fears for the
result of the rash act suggested, that neither heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
footsteps outside the door, and both were surprised
when it opened, and Lady Jennings came in.</p>

<p>She was in her outdoor dress, having just come in,
and was looking cross and worried. She greeted the
girl kindly, but without losing her look of annoyance,
and turned abruptly to Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Buckland, how do you do?&#8221; she said,
holding out her hand to him. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ve come
to tell me what has become of Rachel. She made an
appointment with me at my club at seven, and has
never turned up. She is getting frightfully unpunctual
and tiresome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lilian uttered a little cry of dismay, and Gerard
glanced quickly towards her to remind his hostess of
the young girl&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>Lady Jennings uttered an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me anything about her?&#8221; she asked
imperiously. &#8220;I&#8217;m told you brought back her
cloak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I met her and took her to have some tea.
She had done a long afternoon&#8217;s shopping and was
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afternoon&#8217;s shopping! Why, she had nothing
to buy but a few veils and gloves, that I could have
bought in half an hour,&#8221; cried Lady Jennings impatiently,
thus confirming his own doubts as to
Rachel&#8217;s account of her occupation that afternoon.
&#8220;And where did she go to when you left her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was nonplussed for a moment. He could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
not say that he had thought she was coming straight
home, as that would certainly put Rachel herself into
an awkward position when she did make her appearance.
So he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understood that she was coming here, but I
think she may have missed her cloak and gone back
for it to the shops she had been to.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a good suggestion, and for the time Lady
Jennings was partly appeased. She turned to Lilian,
heard almost without listening the girl&#8217;s account of
the reason of her visit, and then suggested that they
should all go down to dinner together.</p>

<p>But Gerard excused himself, and took his leave.</p>

<p>He knew that there was trouble ahead; that this
mysterious visit to the schoolgirl sister on the part
of the white-haired gentleman who would not give
his name, could only mean disaster for Rachel.</p>

<p>He was torn with anxiety on her account, and, forgetting
his disgust, his doubts, his fears, he set about
contriving some way of helping her to escape from
the difficulties which threatened her.</p>

<p>He excused his eagerness in this perhaps questionable
work, by telling himself that he did not, after all,
know anything against her, that all his suspicions
were mere surmise. But the very fact that he feared
arrest for her betrayed his real belief, and he himself
felt ashamed that he was so eager on her behalf.</p>

<p>More and more startling, as he knew her better,
had grown the difference between her character as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
unfolded in her confidential talk, and the avocations
of which he more than suspected her. She spoke and
looked like a woman of the highest honor, the strongest
sense of right and duty; and yet on every side
he met with circumstances which seemed to point to
her being engaged in crime!</p>

<p>One hope, and only one, remained to him; this was
that she could be proved to be acting under an impulse
so irresistible that what she did was no longer
to be called crime at all, but irresponsibility. But
though he had frequently heard the plea put forward
on behalf of this or that woman afflicted in a similar
manner, it was not surprising that, in spite of himself,
he shrank from accepting, fully and straightforwardly,
this explanation of the conduct of the
woman whom, in the face of every doubt, he felt that
he still loved.</p>

<p>Wistfully, despairingly, he still clung to the hope
that some other way out of the difficulty would be
found; that the mystery about her would be cleared
up satisfactorily, and that he would be able once more
to look upon her with the adoring eyes of his first
day&#8217;s acquaintance.</p>

<p>In the meantime, uneasy and perturbed, he conceived
the idea of going in the direction of the police-station
which was nearest to the stores, with the vague
notion that he might learn something in that neighborhood
of what had happened that afternoon.</p>

<p>So he went part of the distance by train, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
part on foot, and approached the police-station at a
slow pace, looking about him observantly.</p>

<p>The sight that met his eyes as he drew near seemed
to turn him to stone. Rachel Davison, closely veiled
and with bent head, was being led into the building,
with a policeman on one side of her and a man on the
other, whom he recognized by his dress as the one he
had seen going out of the tea-shop that evening,
after giving her a sign that she was to come out.</p>

<p>She had been arrested then, after all!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> was puzzled; he had long since ceased to be
capable of horror at anything he saw done in connection
with Rachel Davison.</p>

<p>He did not even feel sure that she had been arrested;
for he knew by this time that she was, as she had said,
quite capable of taking care of herself, and that,
although it looked as if she were in charge of the
policeman and a detective, she might yet succeed in
escaping from their clutches.</p>

<p>But the amazement he felt on seeing her taken into
the police-station, after she had been able to get out
of the stores in safety, was so intense that he could
do nothing but stare at the three figures as they disappeared
into the police-station, and at the cab which
had brought them as it stood waiting outside.</p>

<p>One very striking circumstance he noted as she disappeared
from his sight. Her appearance had completely
changed since he had seen her last, less than
two hours ago.</p>

<p>When he had put her into the hansom outside the
tea-shop and directed the driver to take her to Lady
Jennings&#8217; house, she had been dressed in pale blue,
with a big hat of the deep color of a sapphire. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
had noted this particularly, as he was struck with
the taste of her dress and had vaguely wondered why
other girls could not manage to look as well-dressed
as she always did.</p>

<p>She had had no cloak with her, as she had left
behind her, in the tea-shop, the handsome dark-blue
mantle, lined with the paler color, which he had himself
taken to Lady Jennings&#8217; for her.</p>

<p>Now, however, Miss Davison was wearing, not the
big blue hat, but a small dark toque swathed round
with one of those large gauze motor-veils which can
be used as an effectual mask for the features.</p>

<p>And her figure was disguised as effectually as her
face; for she wore a large black garment with
voluminous sleeves, and as one side of it flew back
when she ascended the steps to the police-station he
noted that there was, fastened to the hem, a square
white price-ticket, indicating plainly that the mantle
was new from some shop.</p>

<p>This incident seemed to him conclusive and stupefying.</p>

<p>After her narrow escape&mdash;if it was altogether an
escape, which he did not yet know&mdash;of that afternoon,
and after directing him to tell the cabman to
take her home, Miss Davison would appear to have
changed her mind, and to have immediately seized the
opportunity of being alone to do a little more shop-lifting!</p>

<p>Reluctant as he was to come to this conclusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
there seemed to be no other to come to. For he knew
she had not been home, on the one hand, and yet she
was wearing a different hat and mantle since he had
last seen her!</p>

<p>As for any possibility that he could have been mistaken
as to the identity of the lady in the brand-new
cloak and the motor-veil, he knew there was none.
Closely as she was wrapped up, Rachel had made far
too deep an impression upon Gerard for him to fail to
recognize not merely the figure, but the carriage and
the walk, of the woman who had attracted him more
than any other in the world.</p>

<p>He waited at a distance of a few yards to see what
would happen.</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and then a policeman came
out and spoke to the cabman and went into the police-station
again.</p>

<p>Another pause, and then there came out from the
police-station a group of people, among whom Gerard
recognized two of the assistants from the stores, together
with a man who looked like a manager, by his
dress, his air of importance, and the deference paid
him by the other two. There were also two women,
one old and one young, whom he supposed to be two
more assistants, and the bearded man whom Gerard
had supposed to be a doctor.</p>

<p>One of the women was carrying the very toque and
cloak which he had just seen Miss Davison wearing.
This one was put by the rest into the cab which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
waiting, and driven away, while the rest of the party
broke up into twos, and walked in the opposite direction
from where Gerard was standing.</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then a policeman
came out from the station and whistled for a cab,
and a four-wheeler drove up.</p>

<p>Gerard began to grow sick with anxiety, for he
guessed that the next person he should see would be
Miss Davison, and he wondered whether she would be
alone again, or whether she would be in custody.</p>

<p>But he was disappointed, for the next person to
come out was the well-dressed, broad-shouldered young
man whose back he had seen twice already, but whose
face he had never yet contrived to see.</p>

<p>This man, still turning his back to Gerard, opened
the door of the cab, and looked towards the police-station,
out of which, a moment later, Rachel herself
came, dressed once more in her own hat, and wearing
her pale blue dress without any cloak. She ran
quickly out and got into the cab, and the young
man shut the door and remained for some minutes in
earnest conversation with her, as he stood on the pavement.</p>

<p>Even then Gerard was unable to see his face; for
the horse&#8217;s head was turned towards Gerard, so that
the young man had to turn in the opposite direction
to talk to Miss Davison, who was sitting alone in the
cab.</p>

<p>Gerard wondered what had happened. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
been made to give up the new hat and cloak which
she had worn when she came to the police-station.
Yet now she was allowed to go away, without
escort, so that apparently she had not been made
prisoner.</p>

<p>Suddenly and most illogically he was seized with
frantic jealousy of the man beside the cab, whom he
had at first taken for a detective, but whom he now
began to think must be a friend who had interceded
for her, and who had succeeded in getting her freedom.</p>

<p>Had he only become bail for her appearance?
But in that case she would have been taken before a
magistrate in the first place, he was aware; and he
doubted whether there had been time for that, even if
it had been possible to take her away by some back
door, and bring her back to the police-station in the
same way, which would surely not have been necessary
if she had been allowed to go out on bail.</p>

<p>It was only one more of the many mysteries which
surrounded Miss Davison like a network, and Gerard
stared helplessly at her in the darkness which was now
complete but for the light of the gas-lamps, which
were not near enough to cast a light upon her face,
the cab having stopped not exactly opposite to
the police-station, but a few steps farther down the
street.</p>

<p>When the man stepped back from the cab, raising
his hat in farewell, Miss Davison&#8217;s face advanced a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
little into the light, and Gerard was at last able to
see her plainly. She looked haggard, fatigued, and
excited, and it was plain that she had just been
through another harrowing experience.</p>

<p>Suddenly her expression changed to one of alarm,
and he saw that she had recognized him.</p>

<p>Putting her head out of the window, she called to
the driver, who had just started his horse, to stop,
and beckoning imperiously to Gerard, waited at the
cab-window for him to come up.</p>

<p>As he did so, he looked round for the other man,
anxious to get a good look at him; but, in the moment
when Gerard had been occupied with Miss Davison,
the well-dressed man who never showed his face had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Gerard came slowly to the cab-window, raised his
hat in sullen silence, and waited for her to
speak.</p>

<p>For a moment she appeared not to know what to
say to him. Then, in a ferocious undertone, she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been playing the spy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what if I have?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him for a few moments, panting and
angry, before she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to do it, no right at all. Do
you think I haven&#8217;t troubles and cares enough, without
your adding to them by this insulting persecution?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>He drew himself up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can scarcely argue the point here,&#8221; he said
coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. Let me see.&#8221; She paused, and
looked as it were stealthily out of both windows. He
wondered whether she was looking for the man who
had been speaking to her a moment before, the man
who had beckoned her out of the tea-shop; and his
absurd jealousy was roused again. &#8220;You had better
come with me as far as Lady Jennings&#8217;,&#8221; she said
coldly; &#8220;then you will perhaps be satisfied that, for
the present, at least, you have no further need to
play the spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, and then he accepted
the invitation. At any rate, he could warn her of
Lilian&#8217;s visit, and of the message she had brought.
Inconsistent and even unwarrantable as he felt his
partisanship of this girl to be, he was glad of the opportunity
of putting her on her guard against further
dangers.</p>

<p>He got inside the cab, and seated himself opposite
to her.</p>

<p>They drove in silence for some minutes; then she
turned to him fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you come here? Did you follow me
all the way from the tea-shop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. The girl brought out your cloak, which
you had left on a chair, and I took it to Lady Jennings&#8217;.
There, of course, I found that you had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
come home, as you had said you were going to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. And what did you do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with great irritation, not unmixed with
fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I came this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? I know it can&#8217;t have been accidental,
your coming to such a place as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not, of course. I came because I was interested
in the shop-lifting affair that occurred at
the stores this afternoon, and thought that the nearest
police-station would be the place where I was
most likely to get further information about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you come,&#8221; he said presently, in a low voice;
&#8220;and I saw the others. I saw&mdash;oh, why should I
tell you? You know all about it. It&#8217;s horrible. Of
course I know you are justified in saying it is no
business of mine; but still I hate the thought of it
all. And, besides, you may put it, if you like, that
it is merely because I&#8217;m puzzled and curious, and want
to understand it all. Why did you pretend you were
going home, when you were coming here? Who was
the man who beckoned you out of the tea-shop, and
who spoke to you just now? I want to know all
these things, and you may say it is merely curiosity,
if you choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison was sitting back, closing her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
wearily, as if she scarcely heard and did not at all
care what he was saying. When he had finished
speaking she made no attempt to answer him, did
not even open her eyes. There was a long pause.
Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer my questions? Is it because
you can&#8217;t, or because you don&#8217;t care what people
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she opened her eyes, with an expression of
helpless boredom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I answer you? What right have you
to question me? If I choose to say I am going home,
you should be satisfied. And if you follow me, as
you suppose, and find I have not gone home, you
should shrug you shoulders, and tell yourself that it
is no affair of yours. As for what you saw to-night,
what did it amount to? You saw me go into the
police-station&mdash;and you saw me go out of it. Is it
absolutely necessary for me to report the fact to you,
if I get my pocket picked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. But&mdash;the change in your dress
was singular!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m called upon to explain that;
but you can know if you like. I did not wish to
be recognized, as I went in, and so I borrowed some
clothes that, as I supposed, effectually disguised me.&#8221;
She turned to him fiercely again. &#8220;Surely your ill-natured
suspicions ought to be set at rest, since you
saw that I came out as freely as I went in!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;I said nothing about suspicions; but I have something
to tell you. I found your sister at Lady Jennings&#8217;
house, and she had come with a strange message.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foreseeing bad news of some kind, Miss Davison
changed her languid, listless attitude, and sitting up,
looked at him apprehensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, go on. Do you know what brought
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m very sorry, very sorry indeed to have
to worry you with more anxieties when you are tired.
But you had better be prepared to find both your
sister and Lady Jennings rather puzzled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go on, go on,&#8221; said Miss Davison impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that a gentleman called at Richmond&mdash;at
the school&mdash;yesterday, I think&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had got no further when he saw by the sudden
change which came over her face that Miss Davison&#8217;s
listlessness was entirely gone. She was alert, keen,
desperately interested at once. He went on&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman said he was an old friend of your
father&#8217;s, and that he had been in the army himself.
But the singular part of the visit was that he did not
give his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very singular, indeed,&#8221; said Miss Davison.</p>

<p>But though her outward tranquillity was perfect,
it did not deceive Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Graham thought you and Lady Jennings
ought to know about the visit, because he asked a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
good many questions about you. He was, I understand,
a man past middle age, with an upright figure
and a perfectly white mustache.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw at once that Miss Davison recognized the
description, although she raised her eyebrows and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! I suppose he was an old friend of my
father&#8217;s, and that it was only a whim to hide his
name. It&#8217;s absurd of Miss Graham to make so much
fuss about the matter. If it had been anyone without
any knowledge of us, who wanted to scrape acquaintance
with Lilian, you may be sure he would
have given some name, even if it had not been his own.
People who have anything to be ashamed of don&#8217;t do
eccentric things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reasoning was admirable, and Gerard bowed
his head in assent. But for all of that he knew that
the information had thrown Rachel into a state of
deadly fear, and that she was worrying herself with
a new and unexpected anxiety.</p>

<p>For a long time neither spoke, and it was not
until the cab had turned into Sloane Street, and they
were quite near to Lady Jennings&#8217; house that Miss
Davison turned suddenly to him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You pretend to admire me, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; she
asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t pretend, Miss Davison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you admire me, and you take an interest
in me, if only because you look upon me as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
thorough, if rather clumsy appropriator of other
people&#8217;s property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to say that. You know it&#8217;s
not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whatever your motive may be, I want you,
in consideration of this admiration, this interest,
to make me a promise. Will you give me your word
that you will cease this persecution of me, that you
will take it for granted I have my own reasons for
behaving as I do, and that, if I am a criminal, I shall
be punished in due course, and justice will be satisfied?
And will you, in addition to all this, promise
me that you will say nothing to anybody about me or
my doings, that you will try to consider me as unknown
to you, that you will, in short, not only give up
my acquaintance, but behave exactly as if I had never
existed? Listen, Mr. Buckland. I know you to be
an honorable man, and I believe you to be a chivalrous
one. Won&#8217;t you, at my earnest request, leave justice
to take its course upon me without your interference,
and without your knowledge, and leave me to be
dealt with in the natural course of things as I deserve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you explain? I&#8217;m sure you could if
you wished. I won&#8217;t believe you are guilty of a
course of despicable crimes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely immaterial to me whether you believe
that or not,&#8221; retorted Miss Davison, cutting him
short with superb disdain. &#8220;I don&#8217;t ask you to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
I&#8217;m innocent: it&#8217;s not the adjective most applicable
to me. All I ask is that you should leave me
alone, and that, as you have seen that the police have
their eye upon me, you should take it for granted that
they know what I&#8217;m about, and that, when they have
proof enough, they will arrest me, bring me to justice,
and punish me as I deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t believe this&mdash;I can&#8217;t believe the evidence
of my own eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed lightly, having quite recovered her
self-possession, though she still looked pitifully pale
and drawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I don&#8217;t wish you to believe anything
else. Only&mdash;be quite sure that your eyes see aright,
Mr. Buckland, and that you don&#8217;t sometimes see
more than there is to be seen. Now we are at Lady
Jennings&#8217;. Are you coming in?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no invitation in her look or tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Gerard shortly. &#8220;It is too late. Besides,
I&#8217;ve been there already this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not give you any promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with quiet resolution, but without menace
of any sort.</p>

<p>Miss Davison looked grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to go on with this persecution? You
mean to follow me about, to insult me by your
suspicions&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me you did not care what I thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
How then can any suspicions I may have be insulting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let us quibble,&#8221; said she impatiently.
&#8220;I ask you to leave me alone. I wish to drop your
acquaintance, but to do it amicably and without any
ill-will. Or, if you won&#8217;t do that, I ask you to bring
specific charges against me, or even to give information
about me to the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m quite prepared for you to do that. Then
I should have something definite to meet, I should
understand your position. But that you, without
any right to follow me about and persecute me, without
any proof that I have ever done anything disgraceful
or unlawful, should keep watch over my
movements and spy upon my actions, should pay unexpected
calls upon my friends and relations, and
appear to be always at hand when anything unusual
takes place in my family, I say it is infamous, intolerable.
I won&#8217;t put up with it, and I insist that
you shall put an end to this persecution. Now&mdash;promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I refuse to promise,&#8221; said Gerard stubbornly.</p>

<p>The answer, though she might have expected it,
seemed to disconcert her. She appeared to have
thought that her determination, her cold, proud manner,
her lofty indignation, would have had the effect
of reducing him to submission to her will. To find him
stubborn still surprised and perplexed her. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
reached Lady Jennings&#8217; house, and the cab stopped.
Gerard got out. Then Miss Davison, instead of getting
out immediately and sweeping past him haughtily
into the house, as he was prepared for her to do, sat
still a moment, and suddenly threw at him a glance
in which he read a thousand things that in a moment
altered the opinion of her which her words would have
formed. Instead of looking fierce, indignant, cold,
hard, angry, and disdainful, she involuntarily let him
see in her beautiful dark eyes, just for one short
moment, the look which belied all the rest, the look
of womanly gratitude and satisfaction which told that,
mysterious as was her conduct, persistently unreasonable
as was her attitude, and incensed as she had appeared
to be by his obstinacy, she was at heart
touched and melted by his pertinacious loyalty.</p>

<p>Gerard started forward, but before he could speak,
Miss Davison, recollecting herself, sprang out of the
cab, and ran up the steps to the house without a
word or a look of farewell.</p>

<p>Gerard watched her without daring to follow her,
with his heart and brain on fire.</p>

<p>The door opened quickly, and she disappeared into
the house, and the footman came out to pay the cabman.
But Gerard had already done that, and begun
to walk away.</p>

<p>He threw one glance up at the window of the dining-room
as he went. The lights were lowered, and
the blind was drawn up to let the cool night air in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
through the open window. And between the curtains,
standing immovable, he saw the figure of Miss Davison,
and knew that she was watching him, and wondered
what she was thinking.</p>

<p>Remembering that last look of hers, in which the
soul of the woman, grateful for admiration, grateful
for love, had seemed to shine out upon him, he could
not help the belief that she was thinking&mdash;and
thinking kindly&mdash;of him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> Gerard Buckland, although he was very much
in love, was not a fool. And it was not necessary to
consider very deeply the facts connected with the
brilliant Rachel Davison&#8217;s existence to feel quite certain
that, however handsome and however attractive
she might be, it was the height of folly to lose one&#8217;s
heart to a woman of whom so much to her disadvantage
was known to him.</p>

<p>Look at the incidents of the day in whatever way
he might, it was impossible to escape from the conclusion
that Miss Davison&#8217;s share in them was one
inconsistent with that innocence which, as she herself
acknowledged, was not one of her most conspicuous
qualities.</p>

<p>That was the worst of it, that she did not deny the
mystery about her, but challenged him to find it out
if he could. She said in effect that she chose to go
her own way, that her way was one of which he would
not approve, and that she did not care what he
thought. She meant to follow her own inclination,
and she was tired of his pursuit, and desired him to
leave her alone for the future.</p>

<p>He on his side had made no pretense of hiding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
fact that he did not mean to do so, and while more
bewildered than ever by what he had seen and heard
that day, he maintained his determination to try every
means in his power to get at the root of the mystery,
and to find out the secret which was poisoning her
life.</p>

<p>For that Rachel was unhappy he was sure. He
remembered her face as he had first seen it a year
ago at the Aldingtons&#8217; house, how bright her eyes
were, how ringing her voice was. Now, although she
was handsomer than ever in his eyes, with that sort
of suggestion of thought and care underlying her
beauty, which made it pathetic and haunting, now
that the outline of her face had sharpened and grown
more refined than ever, there was a look in her face
which had never been in it before, a sort of defiant
expression, as if she had made up her mind to a certain
distasteful course of action, and meant to persevere
in it in spite of everything.</p>

<p>Gerard was aware that this view of the change in
the beauty might be a somewhat fanciful one; but
fancy is generally very busy in the brain of a young
man in love, and that he was still in love with Rachel
Davison in the face of all he knew and all that he suspected,
he had to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Was she a thief? That he would not believe. Was
she a kleptomaniac? That was even more difficult to
admit, since it was plain that, if kleptomania were
a disease, it could not pay, whereas the occupation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
followed by Rachel certainly appeared to pay very
well.</p>

<p>If she had really been the heroine of the scene at
the stores that day, she must, he knew, have found
someone ready to stand by her, and to tell some story
which found acceptance in the eyes of the persons concerned
in the charge, and saved her from prosecution.</p>

<p>For it was impossible to believe that, worried and
worn out as she was when he left her, she would not
have been infinitely more distressed if she had known
that a police prosecution was hanging over her.</p>

<p>Who was the man who had beckoned her out of the
tea-shop, who had accompanied her to the police-station,
and put her into the cab afterwards?</p>

<p>That was the one question, Gerard felt, upon which
the whole mystery hinged. And he was conscious,
absurd as he felt the sensation to be, that he was not
only curious concerning that important personage,
but actually jealous of him.</p>

<p>Was she in the power of some man who exercised
over her an overwhelming and sinister influence? Was
she under the power of hypnotic suggestion?</p>

<p>He could not but feel sure that the man he had so
dimly seen would prove to have an important bearing
upon the matter, and made up his mind that, at all
hazards, he would find out who he was.</p>

<p>If it should prove to be the case that she herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
was only a more or less helpless instrument in the
hands of a designing and unscrupulous man, then he
felt that her position instead of being a guilty and
infamous one, was pitiful in the extreme.</p>

<p>But the weak point in this argument was the fact
that Miss Davison seemed to be, of all persons in
the world, the least likely to be made a victim in the
way suggested. While essentially feminine, she was
high-spirited, active-minded, full of resolution and
initiative, and wholly unlike the gentle, meek, lymphatic
people who are the most readily subjected to
such experiments.</p>

<p>But then he had heard that highly strung nervous
temperaments are also among the subjects of experiments
of one mind upon another; and whether Miss
Davison could be made submissive to the will of another
depended upon the strength of will in the person
who obtained an influence over her.</p>

<p>This, then, was now Gerard&#8217;s chief object: to find
out and learn all he could about the mysterious man.</p>

<p>If the girl had been, by artful plans, entrapped
into acting as one of a gang of expert thieves&mdash;and,
horrible as this suggestion was, Gerard felt that it
was one that had to be entertained&mdash;then it was the
leader of the gang for whom he must look. And it
was scarcely likely that this leader should have trusted
himself inside the police-station. He thought, therefore,
that he might dismiss the notion that the well-dressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
young-looking man whom he had but half
seen, could be the inspirer and fountain-head of the
organization, if organization there were. Rather,
Gerard thought, would he be a man set to act as a
scout and spy, and to divert suspicion from his companions
by posing as a friend who could answer for
their character.</p>

<p>Gerard, true to his resolution not to let the matter
drop, set about devising an excuse for calling upon
Lady Jennings the very next day; but he was saved
that trouble, for on the following morning he found
on his breakfast-table a note from the old lady asking
him to luncheon that day.</p>

<p>Delighted at this opportunity of seeing Rachel
again, Gerard duly presented himself at a quarter
past one at the pretty little house, where he found
Lady Jennings by herself in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>She was not looking her usual serene self, but was
flushed and irritable, although she greeted the young
man with the kindness she had always shown him.</p>

<p>Gerard soon ventured to ask whether Lilian had
gone back to school the previous night, and Lady
Jennings frowned, though not ill-temperedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I kept her here till this morning, and took
her back myself as far as the station,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;She was in great distress, poor child, because her
sister had been angry with her for coming. But of
course she was quite right to come,&#8221; added the old
lady tartly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;Yes, and it was Miss Graham who sent her, I
understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Rachel has no right to be angry about it,
but she is an odd girl, and full of caprices. I wish
to know where you met her last night. I saw that
you came back in the cab with her, but I cannot find
out from her where she had been or what she had been
doing. Now I quite understand that she is free to
go about by herself, and to transact her business
without interference; but as she is living in my house,
and I feel, as it were, answerable for her, I think she
ought to show me a little more consideration than she
does, and that my curiosity when she misses the dinner-hour
and has no very clear explanation to give
is only natural. She says she was detained by business,
and then she leaves her cloak in a tea-shop, and
presently she returns home with you. So that you
must have met her twice yesterday, Mr. Buckland,
and can, I hope, satisfy what I am sure you will not
think idle curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady, having talked herself out of breath
while Gerard was thus given an opportunity of considering
a diplomatic reply, sat back and paused,
looking at him with pursed-up lips, which he took
as a sort of warning that she expected a straightforward
and full answer.</p>

<p>He did not want to tell too much, or to put her on
the track of Rachel&#8217;s real movements by saying that
he had met her at the stores.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>But at the same time he felt that he might make
worse mischief if he were to say something which
Rachel herself would contradict.</p>

<p>So he said diplomatically&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met her casually, in the first place, near enough
to a tea-shop in Westminster for us to go straight
in there, as she looked tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Westminster!&#8221; echoed Lady Jennings dryly, and
he felt that he had probably &#8220;put his foot in it&#8221;
already. &#8220;What was she doing there, I wonder?
And where&#8221;&mdash;she turned upon him suddenly&mdash;&#8220;did
you meet her the second time?&#8221;</p>

<p>What on earth was he to say? The truth was
not to be thought of. He certainly could not tell
her that he saw Rachel going into a police-station.</p>

<p>She perceived his hesitancy and spoke sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if it&#8217;s a secret, I have no business to
ask, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have every right, Lady Jennings, to know
all about Miss Davison&#8217;s movements,&#8221; answered he
frankly; &#8220;but as I feel that you are asking me questions
to which she herself has given you an insufficient
answer, I feel, don&#8217;t you see, as if I would rather not
say more than this: that I met her not far from
where I had left her before, and that I understood
she had been detained on business connected with
her work.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt, as he said this, that he wished it were
not so true as he feared it was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Lady Jennings half smiled. She approved of his
attitude, but remained unsatisfied with that of her
prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p>

<p>&#8220;She works too hard,&#8221; said Gerard suddenly after
a silence. &#8220;I have noticed a great change in her
looks. Her face now has a worried expression. I
think she wants a long rest, and I wish she could take
it; but I suppose while she is earning so much it&#8217;s
impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady turned upon him with a strange look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose she does earn a great deal,&#8221; she
said rather dryly. &#8220;She seems to spend a great deal,
at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. If she supports her mother and sister,&#8221;
said Gerard valiantly.</p>

<p>But the old lady shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, one may make too much of that,&#8221; she said
quickly. &#8220;She spends money on herself too. She
dresses magnificently. It wouldn&#8217;t have been thought
proper when I was young, for an unmarried girl to
spend so much on her clothes. However, things are
altered now, I suppose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She dresses in excellent taste,&#8221; observed Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. You take a great interest in Rachel,
Mr. Buckland?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were a challenge, and Gerard took it
up promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Greater than I have ever in my life taken in a
woman before,&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>She shrugged her shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I took an interest in any man who was in
want of a wife,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and who thought of looking
in this direction, I should recommend him to
choose the younger sister rather than the elder. Of
course she&#8217;s very young, but she&#8217;s a sweet girl, and
if she has less character, what she has is more amiable
than her sister&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Jennings spoke with as much ill-nature as it
was in her to show, though that was not very much.
Gerard, however, took fire and made a brave stand
for his own choice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Lilian is a lovely girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but pretty
and charming as she is, I confess that a woman of
more character has still greater charm for me. Now
Miss Rachel has not only her beauty, but she has
something besides, some soul, some capacity for deep
feeling which, while no doubt it makes her miserable
sometimes, makes her interesting too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can be miserable no doubt, as well as other
people,&#8221; said Lady Jennings rather dryly; &#8220;but I
think she has probably a still greater capacity for
making others miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly she would make a man miserable if he
were head over ears in love with her and she didn&#8217;t
care for him,&#8221; replied Gerard quickly; &#8220;for he would
never be likely to find any girl to take exactly the
place she had made for herself in his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he had finished speaking he saw a look on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Lady Jennings&#8217; face which made him glance behind
him, and he saw that Rachel herself had come in
quietly while they were talking. It was clear that
she had heard his words and understood them, and
her pale face, which was very grave, lighted up a
little.</p>

<p>She shook hands with him, and exerted herself to
be lively and entertaining, and to dispel that slight
feeling of resentment towards her which she knew
that her erratic ways had caused her protectress to
feel.</p>

<p>They went downstairs together, and she found an
opportunity to ask him what he had said in answer
to the questions about the day before, which she
knew Lady Jennings must have put. She seemed
satisfied and even grateful when he told her, and from
that moment her spirits rose, so that she was the
life and soul of the little party at luncheon.</p>

<p>When they rose from the table they all drifted
towards the window, where Lady Jennings kept her
little birds in a large aviary cage. Rachel was still
very gay, and Lady Jennings&#8217; resentment had softened
under the influence of the girl&#8217;s exertions to
amuse her.</p>

<p>Miss Davison was laughing and talking brightly
when Gerard suddenly perceived a strange change in
her, the brightness dying out of her eyes and the
color out of her lips.</p>

<p>Glancing out of the window in search of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
cause, Gerard saw that a gentleman of the middle
height, erect and of military appearance, with a
snow-white mustache, was passing slowly, and looking
up at the window as he did so; and he knew it
was the visitor to Lilian who would not give his name.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> glanced at Rachel, but she was too much
occupied with her own thoughts, as she stealthily
watched the retreating figure of the erect, middle-aged
gentleman with the snow-white mustache, to
pay any attention to him, or to remark the shrewdness
with which his eye followed the direction of
hers.</p>

<p>The fact was that one glance at the stranger outside
on the pavement, and then another at Rachel,
had been enough to assure Gerard that he had at last
found the key to the mystery which surrounded the
actions of Miss Davison.</p>

<p>True, it was a key which he could not yet make
use of, but he was none the less confident that he now
had it in his hands.</p>

<p>The man in the white mustache, whom Miss Davison
at once recognized, and whose appearance filled
her with evident consternation, was, Gerard felt sure,
the leader of the organization which was using the unhappy
girl for its own illegal ends, and his first care,
on noting this, was to hide every sign that he had seen
anything.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>So he turned to Lady Jennings to give Rachel an
opportunity of recovering her composure.</p>

<p>He was still talking to the old lady when Rachel,
taking out her watch, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot to tell you, Lady Jennings, that I
have to be in the city again this afternoon by four
o&#8217;clock. I shall only just manage it if I run away
now. Do, do forgive me for having forgotten to tell
you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lady Jennings was in no forgiving mood.
The news thus suddenly sprung upon her transformed
her at once from an angel of mildness into
an embodiment of just indignation. Drawing herself
up, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the third time during the last few days
that you have done this, Rachel, disappointed me at
the very moment when we have been going out together!
I can&#8217;t understand how you can make appointments
and forget them in this manner. Even
if I, who don&#8217;t pretend to be a woman of business,
were to do so, I should soon be in a state of hopeless
confusion as to what I had to do and where I had to
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry,&#8221; said Rachel meekly. But even
as she spoke she was walking to the door. &#8220;But
really you don&#8217;t know how difficult it is to reconcile
the two conditions, and to be a woman of business
and a woman of leisure at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went out of the room without giving time for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
any more discussion, and Lady Jennings turned to
Gerard indignantly. The young man had a sympathetic
manner, and old ladies always found in him an
interested hearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too bad of that girl,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;to
treat me in this manner? I make every allowance for
the fact that she is a busy woman, and that business
appointments have to take precedence of social engagements
with her. But when she has expressly
asked me to take her to call on certain people, and at
the last moment she throws me over like this, I really
feel that I have just reason to complain. One can&#8217;t
treat a duchess in this way, whatever one&#8217;s position
may be, and it was to meet the Duchess of Beachborough
that I was going to take her this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; suggested Gerard gently,
&#8220;that it is because she is overworked that she is
rather erratic in her ways just now? It seems to me
that she looks paler every time I see her, and that
her face has grown very much sharper in outline even
during the past few weeks. Couldn&#8217;t you persuade
her to take a rest from business, and to go away for
a thorough change? I feel it would do her all the
good in the world. Six months abroad, for instance,
might make a new woman of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget her circumstances,&#8221; said she. &#8220;How
can a woman who has any sort of business connection,
leave her work for six months? I don&#8217;t know much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
about these things, but I feel sure I am right in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard knew that she was, and found it hard to
continue his argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;a six weeks&#8217; holiday,
then, might be tried with advantage. Don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been talking of taking a holiday,&#8221; said
Lady Jennings rather coolly, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t want her
to go with me. I want a little rest from her tiresome
ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry to hear you say that,&#8221; urged
Gerard earnestly. &#8220;Feeling the interest I do in Miss
Davison, I have always been so glad to think that
she had by her a friend so judicious, so kind, and so
considerate as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Consideration is wasted upon a girl so self-willed.
I don&#8217;t mean to say anything against her.
No doubt if she were not headstrong she would never
have done anything for herself or her people. But
I confess she has tried my patience lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t she go down to her mother for a
little while?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was talking of going away with her and with
Lilian,&#8221; said the old lady; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know whether
she has decided upon anything. She seems now not
to know her own mind for two minutes together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard felt afraid that it was because she was under
the control of a mind other than her own, and was
silent. Lady Jennings sighed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;However,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we must hope it is as you
say, and that a holiday of some sort will work wonders
in her. I wish you, who appear to have some influence
with her&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no; I wish I had!&#8221; interpolated Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would talk to her, and try to persuade
her to be more reasonable. You might show her
that she is doing herself&mdash;and consequently Lilian&mdash;a
great deal of harm by her vagaries. People
won&#8217;t take the younger sister up, as Rachel wants
them to do, if they find the elder is too much of a
handful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was dismayed by what he heard. He felt
that if Lady Jennings were to throw Rachel over,
the girl would be left entirely to the influence of those
false friends who must, he felt sure, be already poisoning
her happiness and spoiling her life. Ineffectual
as Lady Jennings&#8217; friendship and protection
appeared to be in restraining her in her reckless
course of conduct, Gerard clung to the hope that a
short period of rest might bring reflection, and that,
as long as her best friends stood by her, she might
at least be saved from giving herself up wholly to
the bad influences which were at work upon her,
and that he himself might, by probing the mystery
surrounding her to the very bottom, be able
to save her from her dangerous acquaintances, by
threatening to put the police on the track of the
gang.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;I will talk to her,&#8221; said he, in a low voice;
&#8220;though I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t have much effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She likes you very much, I know. She uses
you as an example of what a man should be,&#8221; said
Lady Jennings.</p>

<p>Gerard&#8217;s face brightened in spite of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only this morning she did, in speaking to her
sister. Will you, Mr. Buckland, dine with us to-morrow
night, and see what you can do with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m engaged to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What night can you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go down to some friends on the river
for the week-end. That will take me up to Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is Thursday. Let me see. How will
Wednesday next suit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be delighted to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was on his feet, most anxious to get away,
for he had heard the door shut after Rachel, and he
was determined to follow her and to witness, if possible,
her meeting with the man of the white mustache.
He shook hands with his hostess, and went
away with the proper air of leisured reluctance.</p>

<p>But when once he was outside, he went up the
street at a great pace, taking it for granted that
Rachel, who was no longer in sight, would have gone
in the same direction as the stranger.</p>

<p>He slackened his pace when he got to Sloane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Square, and taking great care never to leave the
shelter of a crowd, a matter which was easy enough
at that time in the afternoon, he looked about him
in all directions for a sign of either the white-haired
man or Miss Davison.</p>

<p>And at last he caught sight of them both, the
man a little in front of the girl, making their way to
the station.</p>

<p>They had no sooner disappeared than Gerard
crossed the road hastily in pursuit, and, still taking
care to keep himself out of their sight, watched them
go down the stairs; taking a ticket himself, he followed
them down to the platform, where they were
now engrossed in conversation.</p>

<p>Gerard had deliberately set himself the task of
getting as near as he could to them without being
seen, in order to overhear, if possible, enough of their
conversation to know in what relation these two
stood to each other.</p>

<p>And, even before he heard a word they were saying,
he knew by what he saw all that he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>For the white-haired stranger, who was a handsome,
well-preserved man of about sixty years of age
or perhaps a little younger, was evidently laying
down the law to Miss Davison, quietly but emphatically,
speaking in such a low voice that not a word
he uttered went beyond her ears, but so effectively
that the girl, who was trembling as she stood with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
bent head before him, listened in absolute submissive
silence to what Gerard felt must be directions,
commands.</p>

<p>Not until their train came in with the usual rattle
and roar, and the hurrying movement among the
passengers began, did the white-haired man raise his
voice. Then Gerard, from behind them, as they
moved towards the train, caught these words uttered
by Miss Davison in a tone of despair&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me off? Haven&#8217;t I done
enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not hear the answer, but he heard a little
faint moan from the girl, which told him that her request
had been refused. Then he heard the man&#8217;s
voice, as he whispered something quickly into the
girl&#8217;s ear, and, raising his hat, immediately hurried
on to a smoking carriage.</p>

<p>Left by herself, Miss Davison got into a first-class
compartment, into which Gerard followed her. She
went quickly to the extreme end of it, and sitting
down with her back turned towards him, affected
to be reading a letter.</p>

<p>But he knew very well that she could not see, that
she was quietly shedding tears, and that, having
heard him get in without guessing who he was, she
had used the pretense of the letter so that, bending
over it, she could dry her eyes furtively without, as
she believed, being observed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>The train started, no other passengers having got
in with them.</p>

<p>They stopped at the next station, and still Rachel
had not moved. Gerard&#8217;s heart bled for her. He
knew that she was miserable, that she was being
coerced, that she was suffering tortures, which must
be doubly keen to a woman as proud as she was, and
that she was in such a position that she could not go
for comfort or advice to any of her friends.</p>

<p>What the conditions were which the white-haired
man had insisted upon with her, what the work was
that he commanded her to do, he could not, of course,
tell. But that there was something distasteful in the
work, something shocking, terrible to her, in the task
he had insisted upon her performing, was no longer
open to question.</p>

<p>The words he had heard her utter in remonstrance
to the man still rang in Gerard&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me off? Haven&#8217;t I done
enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>What was it that she had done already? What
was it that he now wanted her to do? In spite of all
he knew, and all he had seen and heard, in spite of the
suspicions which would crop up at every point of
their acquaintance, concerning the mysterious work
upon which Miss Davison was engaged, Gerard had
never ceased to ask himself whether there might not
be some possible explanation of the suspicious circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
some more favorable interpretation to be
put upon her mysterious actions, than the obvious
one that she was engaged in some sort of criminal
enterprise, or that she was not responsible for her
actions.</p>

<p>This meeting with the man of the white mustache
seemed to make the latter hypothesis untenable.
Kleptomaniacs do not act under orders; they steal
from impulse and impulse alone.</p>

<p>Whereas Rachel was plainly under orders, acting
against her own will, and at the instigation of someone
with a will stronger than her own.</p>

<p>It was utterly incomprehensible to Gerard how a
woman of Miss Davison&#8217;s birth and breeding, a
woman who had seemed to him exceptionally high-principled,
honest, fearless, and strong-willed, should
so far have stifled all the natural and acquired instincts
and principles of an honorable woman as to
have listened to the suggestions of a man engaged
in some sort of nefarious enterprise.</p>

<p>Was the theory of hypnotism to be considered?
Gerard knew very little about the subject, but had
a vague idea that persons under hypnotic influence,
far from protesting, as he had heard her do, against
the power they feel, act like machines, without
strength enough to protest against the will that
makes them commit acts at which, were they free
agents, their minds might well revolt in horror and
dismay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>His heart went out to the girl, in spite of all that
he had heard; and, touched to the quick by the misery
which he knew her to be suffering, he suddenly
left his seat, placed himself near her on the opposite
side of the compartment, and said in a low earnest
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison, what is troubling you? Won&#8217;t
you speak to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl started back, dashed away the tears which
had gathered in her eyes, and sat up and faced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been here all the time, watching me,
spying on me again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone was not passionate, or even indignant.
She was worn out, irritable, impatient. That was
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got in when you got in. Yes, call it spying if
you like, I followed you from Lady Jennings&#8217; house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; interrupted she impatiently. &#8220;I
thought I had slipped away without your seeing me,
but I might have known you were too clever for me.
Pray, what made you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had dashed away her tears, sat up, and tried
to resume her ordinary manner. She was evidently
not sure how much he knew, and was trying to
&#8220;bluff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard looked down and answered quietly. He
must tell her all he knew, in the hope that she would
then admit the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came because I knew&mdash;or at least I guessed&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
you were going to meet someone, someone
whom you saw from the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have keen eyes!&#8221; she said sarcastically.</p>

<p>She might mean that he had seen more than there
was to be seen, or merely that she admitted there
was something to see which he had been quick to notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are keen where you are concerned, Miss
Davison. It is no secret to you, or to anybody who
knows us, that whatever concerns you is of the deepest
interest to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a movement as if she would have answered
him in the same tone as before, with sarcasm,
with coldness, with an air of being offended;
but before she could utter a word, she glanced
askance at him, and something in his look and manner
made her expression change. She looked down
suddenly, and he saw her lower lip quiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said querulously,
like a child. &#8220;Of what use is it to be interested in
me, considering what you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late for me to ask if it&#8217;s of any use,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Besides, isn&#8217;t it just possible that it may
be of use&mdash;to you&mdash;to know that there is someone
to whom you could go if you were in a difficulty,
someone who knows so much already that there
would be little harm in telling him the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw a frightened glance at him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;You know nothing,&#8221; she said sharply. &#8220;You
may guess a great deal, and put a wrong construction
upon everything; but you really know nothing
whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you are in some way in the power,
or under the influence of a man who wishes you to
do things against which you revolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident that, whatever she might pretend,
Miss Davison was startled by this statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>He went on, without answering her question&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that you have protested, and protested apparently
in vain, against his suggestions, or orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she understood, and did not pretend to misunderstand
or deny any longer&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been eavesdropping,&#8221; she said contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not scruple to do anything that would
lead to a better understanding of the marvel that
makes a well-bred, honorable woman do things
which she is ashamed of, and that she does not dare
to mention to her family and friends,&#8221; retorted
Gerard boldly.</p>

<p>She stared at him, with her lips parted, her eyes
very wide open, her breast heaving. Both were in
terrible earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk nonsense,&#8221; she said at last sharply.
&#8220;All your listening and spying only result in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
learning half the truth; and if you were wise, not
to say chivalrous, you would take it for granted
that you were mistaken in your evil thoughts of me,
and that there is just something to be learned which
I do not choose to tell you, and which you have no
possible right to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could believe you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wish
to Heaven I could. But it&#8217;s impossible to credit
that you, a young girl, should have secrets from all
your friends and relations in which there is no
harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>She faltered and her eyes fell under his gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harm!&#8221; she echoed, in a hoarse voice. &#8220;There
are different degrees of harm. What one person
thinks justifiable may shock and disgust another
person. If your ideas of what is right are so very
lofty, you have no right to take for granted that
mine, which may be rather lower, are degrading and
wholly unjustifiable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take nothing for granted. I only see that
you are miserable and unhappy, and that you are
so because you are acting against your conscience
at the bidding of a person whom you fear and whose
influence you know to be bad,&#8221; retorted Gerard.</p>

<p>She made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why begin the old arguments all over again?&#8221;
she said shortly. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you see for yourself
that I have willingly and with open eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
adopted a certain course, and why don&#8217;t you leave
me alone to endure the punishment if I have done
wrong, or to receive the reward if I have done right?
Believe me, you are only harassing me, adding to my
troubles and embarrassments by your persistent persecution.
Nothing will turn me from the course I
have entered upon, about which I will only say this,
that I entered upon it of my own free will, with
entire knowledge of its promises and possible rewards,
and of its disadvantages as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would leave you alone if you were happy,&#8221;
burst out Gerard. &#8220;It is because I see you are
miserable and harassed, because I hear you imploring
to be let off doing that which you have been
ordered to do, that I beg you to leave this career,
and its rewards, and the rest of it, at any rate for a
time. If you would only leave London for a while,
go away somewhere and rest and forget this work
and all its troubles, I would be content. But until
you do, until I know that you are taking the rest
and holiday you need, I shall continue what you
call my persecution, in the hope of being near you
at the moment&mdash;which is sure to come&mdash;when you
will want a friend to stand by you, a better one than
those for whom you are working now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was conscious that he was weak in argument,
and that his lame words would have but little effect
against the resolve which set her mouth firm and
shone in her mournful eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>What he had not been prepared for, however, was
the gentleness with which she received this tirade, as
she stood up in the compartment and prepared to get
out at the next station.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are only adding to my difficulties,&#8221; she
said, in a tone of mournful resignation. &#8220;I quite
appreciate the kindness of your motives, but your
actions worry and harass me. In gratitude for
your good intentions I say &#8216;Thank you.&#8217; But in
self-defense, as you are with the best will in the
world doing me a decided injury, I must say also:
I wish to Heaven I had never met you, and that I
may, now that I have had the misfortune to meet
you, never meet you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ended with a sort of stifled sob.</p>

<p>The cruel words stabbed Gerard to the heart. He
uttered an incoherent protest, but she would not
listen. Going quickly to the end of the compartment,
she remained standing, with her back turned towards
him and without uttering another word, until the
train stopped at the next station, when she hurriedly
got out, ran up the steps, and jumped into a hansom,
leaving him, remorseful, uneasy, and miserable,
on the platform.</p>

<p>He had jumped out after her, but saw that it was
ridiculous to think of further pursuit.</p>

<p>But a glance at the moving train as it went out
of the station showed him, in one of the compartments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the face of the white-haired gentleman, with
a faint smile on his cold features.</p>

<p>And Gerard, who saw that the mysterious stranger
was looking at him, with a sort of faint, cold contempt
upon his face, wondered vaguely whether he
had not seen those well-cut features, and that inscrutable
expression, somewhere before that day.</p>

<p>And as he walked away and thought the matter
over, the impression grew stronger and stronger
upon him that, either in a picture or in the flesh,
he had seen the man&#8217;s face before.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the very last day of July, when the
season had come to an end, and streams of luggage-laden
cabs were flowing in the direction of all the
great railway stations, that Gerard kept the engagement
he had made with Lady Jennings, and arrived
at her house in time for dinner.</p>

<p>During the days which had elapsed since the
luncheon at her house, and his pursuit of Miss Davison
and the mysterious white-haired man, Gerard
had seen and heard nothing whatever of the girl, and
had indeed done his best to think of other things,
and to push her image out of the unduly prominent
position which it had occupied in his mind if not in
his heart.</p>

<p>The attempt had been, of course, unsuccessful.
And it was with the strongest possible feelings of
passionate interest, and in a state of keen excitement,
that he presented himself again at the house
of her old friend and protectress, and found his
heart beating high at the thought of seeing her
again.</p>

<p>Lady Jennings, however, came into the drawing-room
alone, and though three or four other guests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
came in almost immediately, Miss Davison did not
appear.</p>

<p>Gerard&#8217;s spirits sank when the gong sounded, and
they all went down to dinner, and he saw, with dismay,
that all the places were filled, and that the
woman in whom his thoughts were centered was absent
from the circle.</p>

<p>No explanation of her absence was asked for by
anybody.</p>

<p>He was so depressed that, although he of course
took his share in the general conversation and exerted
himself to appear unmoved by his disappointment,
he felt sure that his hostess noticed it. When
she and the other ladies left the room, he asked the
oldest of the men present, who was a constant visitor
at the house, what had become of Lady Jennings&#8217;
young friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, haven&#8217;t you heard? There&#8217;s been a split,
I believe, a misunderstanding, quarrel, or something
serious of that sort. I don&#8217;t know the details myself,
and I can&#8217;t find out more than that. But Lady
Jennings is very sensitive about it, and will not
broach the subject with anybody, while one gets
snubbed if one starts it oneself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was on thorns.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did it happen?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly; but it was within the last
few days. One by one her friends, as they called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
found Miss Davison missing, and gradually so much
has leaked out, and no more. So be warned.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gerard could not accept the warning; he did
not care two straws about Lady Jennings&#8217; anger,
compared with Rachel&#8217;s fate. And he had already
decided to ask his hostess direct what had become of
her young companion.</p>

<p>In the meantime the gloomiest doubts and forebodings
filled his heart. Even that latest adventure
with her had not cured the longings he felt for a
sight of her, for a touch of her hand, for a look into
those beautiful, mournful, enigmatic eyes, which
had stirred him as no woman&#8217;s eyes had ever done
before.</p>

<p>He made an opportunity of approaching Lady
Jennings, and at once, in defiance of the warning
he had received, asked where Rachel was, and whether
she had consented to take a holiday.</p>

<p>The old lady&#8217;s face hardened, and her manner
grew cold as she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what has become of her, Mr.
Buckland; I have broken off the acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it indiscreet to ask on what grounds?&#8221; asked
Gerard steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I should say it is indiscreet, decidedly.
But as I know you take an interest in the girl, I&#8217;ll
tell you the reason. She has formed an acquaintance
with some people of whom I don&#8217;t approve&mdash;Americans.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Gerard looked surprised. He knew that he had
met several charming Americans at the house. The
old lady perceived his bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t object to these Van Santens because
they&#8217;re Americans,&#8221; she explained; &#8220;but because
they are a type of Americans whom I dislike,
and of whom I disapprove.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard had heard the name of Van Santen and
knew that these people had made some sort of stir
in certain circles during the past season by novel and
tasteful entertainments, which had earned them the
way into a good &#8220;set.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know them,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but I know
some people who do, and who find them very charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt,&#8221; retorted the old lady icily; &#8220;but
I am old-fashioned, and these Sunday bridge-parties
which they give down at a place they have hired in
Hertfordshire are things of which I strongly disapprove.
I don&#8217;t like the thing, to start with, and I
don&#8217;t like the way it is done, as far as I have heard
anything of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear there has been a rupture between
you and Miss Davison upon such an unimportant
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is important in my eyes, though I daresay
some people might think me too strict. But,
as you must know, we have been getting on so much
less well together for some time, that a comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
small thing was able to complete the separation.
We won&#8217;t refer to it further, please. I will only
say this, that my quarrel, or disagreement&mdash;whatever
you like to call it&mdash;with the elder sister, will
not prevent my doing what I can for the younger.
And I hope that Rachel&#8217;s absence from my house
will not cause you to forsake it, Mr. Buckland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Gerard protested that it would not,
and equally of course he knew in his own heart that
he would never care to come near the place again.
He cherished quite an unreasonable resentment, indeed,
against the old lady, for what he felt to be an
unjustifiable desertion of Rachel in her hour of need;
and this in spite of his knowledge that Rachel was
one of those difficult persons to deal with who make
their own troubles, and persist in their own chosen
line of conduct in defiance of the will and wishes of
anybody.</p>

<p>The evening was a dull and tiresome one for him,
and when he got to his rooms that night he spent
two or three hours in deep thought on the subject
of Rachel, and was surprised and ill pleased to find
how deeply he felt the disappointment at not having
seen her.</p>

<p>He remembered where he had heard talk about
the Van Santens, the lively and charming Americans
who had supplied a fresh zest that year to the entertainments
of London society. It was at the
Aldingtons&#8217; that he had heard the family discussed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and Arthur Aldington had been quite proud of being
invited to their house, as the Americans had found
open to them the doors of many houses which would
have been rigidly closed to English people of the
standing which the Van Santens occupied in their
native country.</p>

<p>So on the following Sunday he went down to the
Aldingtons&#8217; house on the river, where they spent
the summer months, and found out all he could about
this American family of whom Lady Jennings disapproved.</p>

<p>Arthur was delighted to talk about them, and expatiated
upon the superior charm of American over
English girls, and especially about the dainty beauty
and grace of Cora Van Santen, who, he said, was
quite the most charming girl he had met in London
that season.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to know them?&#8221; asked Arthur,
quite proud to introduce his handsome friend among
his new and smart acquaintances. &#8220;If so, I&#8217;ll take
you down in the car one Sunday. They keep open
house on Sunday always, whether in town or in the
country; and I have a general invitation, and can
bring a friend when I like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard caught at the chance of seeing these
people, and of deciding whether Lady Jennings
could have any serious complaint to make against
them, or whether, as he thought more likely, she had
merely made use of them as an excuse for breaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the relationship with the young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e who had
offended her by her erratic ways.</p>

<p>The two young men went down the very next Sunday
to the Priory, which proved to be a very much
modernized old house, which the Americans had
rented furnished from an English baronet.</p>

<p>It was a charming old place; and although these
newly arrived rich people had brought down with
them from town, and even across with them from
New York, certain novelties necessary to their comfort,
they had had discretion enough to avoid
swamping the old with the new so that the house
presented an appearance of refined comfort and
luxury most attractive to the eye.</p>

<p>The family consisted of five persons, and the
first thing that Gerard, who had grown keen in observation
of late, noted about them was that they
all represented different types in form and feature.</p>

<p>Delia, the eldest girl, was what Arthur Aldington
irreverently called the nut-cracker type, and was
a showy, tall woman, some thirty years of age,
vivacious, talkative, and amusing.</p>

<p>Cora, the younger girl, was much shorter, and was
a dainty, pale girl of twenty-five, who dressed with
studied simplicity, and sang with great charm and
sweetness. Indeed, her voice was one of the family
assets, and being well trained, had been one of the
most valuable aids in the family rise to the enviable
position they already occupied in English society.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>The mother was a dry, quiet American woman,
very shy and watchful, as if not quite sure of herself
among her motley brood.</p>

<p>The rest of the family consisted of two old-young
men, whose age seemed to be greater than would
have been expected in the brothers of the girls, but
who were supposed to be sons by a former wife of
the head of the family, Mr. Van Santen, who was
shortly expected from America.</p>

<p>Neither was like the sisters; the one being withered
and bent, with long teeth and a curious hard smile,
while the younger of the two was a tall, rather good-looking
man with a little fair mustache which he
appeared to have only recently grown, a deep voice
and a genial and almost homely manner.</p>

<p>The group was an interesting one, yet there was
something about this household which Gerard did not
like&mdash;a strange, unwholesome atmosphere.</p>

<p>The afternoon was not far advanced when two
parties were formed for bridge-playing, and a third
for poker. Gerard did not play, but he kept his eyes
open while the play went on, and listened, entranced,
when Cora sang for the guests.</p>

<p>Her beautiful voice, indeed distracted some of the
card-players, although they were in two of the suite
of drawing-rooms opening on the terrace, and she
was in the third.</p>

<p>Gerard thought he had never heard any voice so
sweet as that of this pale girl with the washed-out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
blue eyes, and the soft, colorless hair brushed straight
back in a high full roll from her forehead. As he
stood at the piano, while her mother played her accompaniments,
he thought, looking at her slender
figure, with her hands clasped behind her and her
plain white muslin dress falling in full folds round
her, without any other ornament than a wide white
satin sash, that she made a most charming picture
against the background of old tapestry which was
one of the attractions of the music-room.</p>

<p>He was still listening enraptured to her singing
of an old ballad which he had never admired before,
when Arthur Aldington and another young fellow
who had been playing cards all the afternoon came
to join him on the terrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cleaned out,&#8221; said Arthur. &#8220;This singing
is beautiful but it doesn&#8217;t go well with card-playing.
I&#8217;m not the only man who has quite lost his head
between the two. Card-playing for high stakes and
lovely music don&#8217;t go well together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard listened with attention. The very same
idea had entered his own head some time ago, and
he wondered how any of the men could keep their attention
sufficiently fixed on the cards to play either
poker or bridge within hearing of Miss Cora Van
Santen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I should have thought,&#8221; said
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course her two brothers, who are used to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
music can keep their heads,&#8221; went on Arthur, who
rather resented the inroads which the afternoon&#8217;s
play had made in his allowance; &#8220;so they made
money, while we lost it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Innocently as this was said, the speech struck
an unpleasant note in the mind of Gerard, who had
grown much more suspicious of late than he was by
nature inclined to be. He was pondering the words,
when presently he heard Arthur&#8217;s voice, behind him,
saying with surprise and delight&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, you here! I am pleased to meet you.
Are you staying here, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m staying here,&#8221; answered a voice which
Gerard recognized.</p>

<p>And, in vague horror, he turned to find that this
guest at the house of the Van Santens was no other
than Rachel Davison. There was a mutual look of
alarm in the eyes of the girl and Gerard as he turned
sharply and found himself face to face with her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Priory gardens were looking lovely under the
rays of the hot sun of the fading August afternoon;
but the harmonious tints of tree and lawn, of bank
and blossom, faded into an indistinct mass before the
eyes of Gerard Buckland as he turned away from
Rachel Davison, after a low-voiced greeting which
he uttered mechanically, without knowing what he
said.</p>

<p>If she had been unmoved at the meeting, or if
her manner and look had been different, he would
not have been so much perturbed as he was. But
it was not merely that she looked infinitely surprised,
startled, and alarmed at the sight of him, but that
there was in her face an expression which seemed to
bear only one possible interpretation: she looked
guilty.</p>

<p>Try as he would to forget the impression her face
made upon him at that first moment of astonishment
at the meeting, he could not banish the disagreeable
impression.</p>

<p>She had turned at once from him, after the first
words of greeting, to speak again to Arthur Aldington,
and to make inquiries after the rest of his family.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
But Gerard saw in this rapid turning away from himself
only another proof of guilty consciousness on
her part that he was there and that he was watching
her.</p>

<p>He turned away into the gardens, leaving the terrace
and going down towards the broad fish-pond,
which lay in a hollow at the end of a series of velvety
lawns broken up by flower beds which were a mass
of tall, handsome, flowering plants.</p>

<p>The gardens were one of the sights of the county,
and even in the state of uneasiness and anxiety from
which he was suffering, Gerard was conscious of
their beauty.</p>

<p>So, too, were other people. For wandering about
among the high hedges of yew and over the soft
lawns, he found a dozen groups of two and three persons,
enjoying the warm summer air, and gathering
under the shade of the lime trees where Mrs. Van
Santen was pouring out tea.</p>

<p>The lady threw at Gerard the apprehensive glance
with which she greeted everyone who approached her
whom she did not know well. He looked at her narrowly,
but there was nothing in the least suspicious
about her; she was a plain-featured, motherly woman
who gave the impression of being more used to a
simple, homely style of life than to the state which
now surrounded her; and the gentleness with which
she evidently tried to live up to the new life prepossessed
him in her favor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>She smiled at him rather shyly, and invited him
to take a seat beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m new to this,&#8221; she said, with a strong American
accent, as she poured him out a cup of tea;
&#8220;to all this company, I mean. I&#8217;m used to a quieter
sort of life altogether; and your smart British
society folks make me shiver some!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you won&#8217;t look upon me as belonging
to the people who make you shiver,&#8221; said
Gerard, much taken with her gentle looks and her
homely form of speech. &#8220;So you don&#8217;t like us,
Mrs. Van Santen, so much as your friends on the
other side of the Atlantic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; replied Mrs. Van Santen, in
the slow drawl which Gerard found rather attractive.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt many of the people who frighten me
because I&#8217;m not used to them only need to be better
known. But it&#8217;s just this, Mr. Buckland, when
you&#8217;ve been used to a quiet, homely kind of life, and
you get suddenly plunged into a livelier sort, why,
it takes you time for you to feel your feet, you
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it does. But why should you be
forced to lead anything but the kind of life you
like, and you&#8217;re used to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s like this,&#8221; said the good lady confidentially;
&#8220;you Britishers think a mighty deal
more of the dollars than folks do over on the other
side!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Gerard in amazement. &#8220;We
always think it&#8217;s the other way about!&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head shrewdly, and brushed back
the braids of her grayish hair, which she wore parted
in the middle and done in a severely plain knot behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew the value of money,&#8221; she said emphatically,
&#8220;till I came over here. Where we come
from there are many who have money, and nobody
thinks much of us; but over here we find friends
among the smart people, and yet there&#8217;s nothing to
make us stand out from other folks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is, by what I hear&mdash;and what I
see,&#8221; added Gerard courteously. &#8220;Your younger
daughter, Miss Cora, has a voice that we very rarely
hear except on a professional platform, and everyone
says you give entertainments which are unique.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything so special about them,&#8221; she
said simply, &#8220;except that perhaps we&#8217;re not so stiff
as you English people. But I should have thought
that was against us, instead of being in our favor!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a great deal of pretense and what we
call cant about us English,&#8221; admitted Gerard. &#8220;We
have bound ourselves by very rigid rules; but we like
to escape from them sometimes, and we do it by
going abroad, or by visiting people of wider notions
than our own.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it, is it? Well, I daresay, you&#8217;re
about right. But it&#8217;s puzzling too, to see how your
great ladies and your smart men come to see us,
when on our own side we&#8217;re not thought much of.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible not to like this simple homely
creature, with her lasting wonder at the ease with
which she and her family had established themselves
in London society, and the freedom with which they
had been &#8220;taken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard found it less surprising than she did.
The very mixture of simplicity and homeliness, as
represented by the gentle middle-aged woman who
disdained the aid of much extravagance in dress, and
frankly spoke her mind about herself and her family,
with the grace and accomplishments of the daughters,
and the devotion to cards of the sons, formed a combination
new and attractive to people who were tired
of more commonplace households.</p>

<p>And the cleverness with which the Van Santens
had chosen to locate themselves in one of the prettiest
places near London, and the taste with which they
had respected the beauties in which they found themselves,
all combined to make the Priory the most popular
resort of the moment with a considerable portion
of the great world.</p>

<p>A few belated stayers in London, who found a delightful
Sunday resort in the Priory, and a great
many people staying in the country houses and river
villas came over each week-end in their motor-cars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
to spend a few hours in the merry atmosphere, unburdened
with Sabbatarian restrictions, of the lively
Americans.</p>

<p>While he was still sipping tea and chatting with
Mrs. Van Santen, the sight of Rachel Davison, coming
slowly from the house, accompanied on one side
by the younger and better-looking of the two male
Van Santens, made Gerard frown with displeasure.</p>

<p>Miss Davison was exquisitely dressed, as usual, and
looked exceedingly handsome in a gown of black lace
with a long train and lines of jet upon it, finished
with enormous jet tassels. A large number of tassels,
similar in design, but of smaller size, dangled
from her bodice; and from underneath the short, full
black sleeves and up to the throat from the slightly
open black bodice, an underbodice and sleeves, very
full and of creamy white transparent material, peeped
out, finishing the costume with a relieving touch.</p>

<p>Her dark hair, coiled high and fastened by amber
and jet combs and pins, set off the delicate pallor of
her face.</p>

<p>Gerard, who had never conquered the jealousy
with which he looked upon any other man who
seemed to attract any of her attention, frowned when
he noted the evident admiration of the younger Van
Santen, who was tall, broad-shouldered, and good-looking.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because he hated the sight of a
good-looking man near Miss Davison that Gerard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
took an instinctive and strong dislike to this Denver
Van Santen, and told himself that the fellow was ill-mannered,
presumptuous, and &#8220;bad-form&#8221; altogether.</p>

<p>On the other side of Miss Davison was an Englishman,
a young baronet, who was already making himself
conspicuous by the rapidity with which he was
dissipating the fortune which he had recently inherited
with the title.</p>

<p>Gerard, uneasily glancing from the one to the
other, and from these three to the groups of gay
visitors who were laughing and talking around them,
wondered what sort of position the rest of the
guests held, and whether there were many present of
the type represented by the spendthrift young baronet.</p>

<p>There were two or three racing ladies, women of
birth and position, whose rank enabled them to go
fearlessly wherever they fancied, without calling
down upon themselves the decree of banishment which
lesser mortals can only avoid by extreme discretion.</p>

<p>Gerard wondered whether the ladies he saw were
all of that venturesome type, and whether it was
considered rather a daring thing to visit these bridge-playing
Americans in the snug retreat they had
chosen for themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Davison had been brought to the
group under the lime trees, and placed in a comfortable
chair, and waited upon assiduously by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
two young men who had accompanied her from the
house.</p>

<p>Sir William Gurdon, the young baronet, was complaining
of his ill-luck at poker. Denver Van Santen
laughed at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wants a cool head&mdash;poker,&#8221; he remarked;
&#8220;and to keep your mind on what you&#8217;re doing.
That Cora and her singing were enough to distract
anybody. We&#8217;ll get farther away from the music
this evening, if we play any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Sir William. &#8220;I should awfully
like to play again, but I don&#8217;t want to make such a
duffer of myself as I did this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re cut out for a poker-player.
If I were you I should give it up,&#8221; said Denver, in
a decided tone.</p>

<p>Sir William resented this as an imputation that he
was not cool-headed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you should say that,&#8221; he said
rather sharply. &#8220;I suppose poker has to be learned
like everything else, and probably you play it better
now than when you first began.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denver shook his head modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always,&#8221; he said; &#8220;sometimes I&#8217;m an arrant
duffer at it. Why the other day I was cleaned out,
absolutely cleaned out, by a fellow who hadn&#8217;t played
half a dozen times in his life. I <i>did</i> feel a fool, I
can tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall try again with me this evening,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the baronet. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be beaten without
a struggle, at that or at anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denver, however, tried to dissuade him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll only get licked,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;Whatever
sort of a player you may make some day, and
if you go on trying I suppose you will do all right
in time, you&#8217;re not strong enough to play with old
hands like me and the two others who were with us
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Santen shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an almighty shame to play cards all Sunday!&#8221;
she said, in her homely way. &#8220;I wonder
you&#8217;re not ashamed of yourself, Denver, to start
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so I am, perhaps,&#8221; said he good-humoredly;
&#8220;but I love cards, and if anyone else
wants to play, I&#8217;m ready to take him on, you bet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison, seated near Mrs. Van Santen, was
sipping tea and nibbling bread and butter.
Gerard, when the other two young men grew warm
in discussion of poker and moved away a little, took
the seat beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Different this, from the way the Aldingtons
spend their Sunday!&#8221; said he, in a low voice as
soon as their hostess had turned to talk to someone
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rachel. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather shocking&mdash;till
you get used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would always seem shocking to me,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
said Gerard. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have any strong
Sabbatarian instincts, but I suppose the old Puritan
survives in us English, for I must confess that to see
cards played all day on Sunday grates upon me; and
I should have thought,&#8221; he added quickly, in a lower
voice, &#8220;that it would have grated on you too.&#8221;</p>

<p>This home-thrust made her blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;One has to make allowance,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for
other people&#8217;s ways. It&#8217;s quite true, as you say, that
one&#8217;s Puritan instincts revolt from the continual
card-playing; but I suppose that very strict people
would say it&#8217;s just as wrong to amuse oneself as one
does at the Aldingtons&#8217;, with music and conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how there could be the same objection
to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a question of degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that you really wouldn&#8217;t mind if we all, at
the Aldingtons&#8217;, were to sit down to poker and baccarat,
instead of spending the Sundays there as we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t see that we are called upon to decide
those questions,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Each one must lay
down his own laws of conduct. As a matter of fact,
it&#8217;s a sentiment, and not any law, human or divine,
that guides us in the matter, isn&#8217;t it? You can&#8217;t pretend
that card-playing comes under the head of
work, can you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Stung by what he took to be her indifference,
Gerard made a very indiscreet speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Work! I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Miss Davison turned to him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, what do you mean?&#8221; she asked sharply.</p>

<p>But he did not venture to say more. Indeed, he
felt that he had nothing to say. He could not well
have defined the secret instinct which made him
vaguely suspect that there was something wrong
about the play, just because Miss Davison was in the
house at the time.</p>

<p>He certainly would not have liked to avow that
that was his reason for his faint suspicions. But
that it was because Rachel, who had been concerned
none the less he knew, at the bottom of his heart,
in other dubious transactions, was present at the
Priory, that he suspected, on hearing that Arthur
Aldington had lost his money, that all was not as
fair as it looked in the play.</p>

<p>He stammered and would have changed the subject;
but she would not let him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you don&#8217;t imagine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you
would meet Lady Sylvia and the Marchioness at
houses where there was anything wrong! I&#8217;m afraid,
Mr. Buckland, you let your Puritanism carry you a
great deal too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with so much emphasis that he felt
ashamed of what he had said, the more so that he
really had no grounds for supposing that the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
wealthy young Americans would do anything that
was not fair. Indeed, he had himself heard one of
them trying to persuade a silly fellow not to play
poker any more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, in a shame-faced manner, &#8220;I
admit that there&#8217;s something so distasteful to me in
seeing men win money under their own roof, that I
said what I had no right to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you admit so much,&#8221; said Rachel with
dignity. &#8220;It is not a very nice suggestion to make
that my friends, the people in whose house I am staying,
are other than honorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remembering what he was forced to suspect concerning
her, Gerard could not help casting at her a
quick glance, at which she blushed again.</p>

<p>She knew very well that he suspected her of complicity
in other risky adventures, and she had no
right to challenge him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I suppose I ought to apologize,
but I confess that if I am forced to play cards here,
and one feels awkward at refusing always, when one
is asked, I shall feel very despondent at having to pit
myself against such a lot of good players.&#8221;</p>

<p>A change came over Rachel&#8217;s face. For a moment
she sat silent, but then she rose from her chair,
and with a glance which invited him to follow her,
sauntered away to a flower-border, where she stopped,
as if to admire the mass of gorgeous blossom in
front of her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>He looked at her, as she stood, a beautiful and
even queenly figure, in her glittering black dress
against the green of the foliage and the rich coloring
of the flowers; and if she had turned at that moment
she would almost have been able to read in
Gerard&#8217;s face the feeling at his heart, the passionate
wistful longing to know the truth, the whole truth
about her, to learn, for good or ill, the secret which
he knew was gnawing at her heart, to be able to tell,
once for all, whether the woman who attracted him
in spite of his knowledge, in spite of his judgment,
was worthy or unworthy of an honest man&#8217;s love.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was quite near to her before she spoke, and then
she did so without looking up. In an off-hand
tone, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have expected you to play cards,
after what you&#8217;ve said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really! What have I said to imply that I
should never, in any circumstances, play cards?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are trifling,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I meant that,
after all you&#8217;ve said about Sunday, and about these
people playing so well, it would be inconsistent on
your part to play here to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be obliged to. One doesn&#8217;t like to stand
out when everybody else is playing,&#8221; said Gerard.
And, with an uneasy feeling that he was going to
have some hint given him, he drew her out. &#8220;I happen
to have some money with me. I can&#8217;t say I
could afford very well to lose all of it, but after all,
at poker, and these gambling games, it isn&#8217;t always
the old hands that win.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with vivacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would be very foolish to expect to win,
pitted against men like these two idle Van Santens,
who care more for cards than for anything else.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;Do you mean that you advise me not to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I do. Just as I should advise any
man not to try his rawness against the skill of practiced
players at cards or at anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they always play for such high stakes?&#8221;
asked Gerard abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. They&#8217;re rich men, and there&#8217;s no excitement
for them unless the stakes are high. And
I may tell you that, rich as they are, they like winning
as much as any poor man could do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard looked at her steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I say what I think, Miss Davison?&#8221; he
asked, after a short pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if it&#8217;s anything disagreeable,&#8221; she said
quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard too many unpleasant speeches
from you, Mr. Buckland, and for the future I command
you to keep silence with me unless you have
something to say which I shall be pleased to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to speak flippantly, but there was an underlying
seriousness, nay, distress, in her look and
tone, which told him that she was no happier than
she had been when he last met her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to say what I had in my mind, all the
same,&#8221; he said, in a voice full of deep feeling. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only this: I&#8217;m sorry to see you here, Miss Davison.
It&#8217;s a change for the worse from Lady Jennings&#8217;
house, and I&#8217;m sure you must feel it so. Why did
you quarrel with her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>She was deadly pale, but she tried to hold her own
and to carry matters with a high hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you&#8217;re rather
indiscreet, Mr. Buckland, to presume to lecture me
upon my actions? If I find that I am uncomfortable
in the house of one friend, surely it is my own affair
if I try another? And pray what fault have you to
find with Mrs. Van Santen? Isn&#8217;t she a dear old
lady, quite as kind in her way as Lady Jennings?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard frowned in perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose so,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Still, the whole
atmosphere is different, the tone is lower; and what
you gain in liveliness and gayety&mdash;and I suppose
you do gain there&mdash;is, in my opinion, more than
made up for by what you lose in refinement. There&mdash;I&#8217;ve
offended you deeply, I know; but I don&#8217;t care.
It had to be said; and I shall never be satisfied until
I see you back again at the little house where you
seemed to be at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon him again, in the old way, ready
with some haughty speech expressive of her annoyance
at his presumption; but, as she did so, she met
his eyes. And, just as it had happened before, it
happened again; she caught her breath; she could
not go on; and with her eyes full of sudden tears,
and head which bent over the flowers as if to hide
her face, she remained silent, while he stood also
mute, excited, moved, longing wistfully to make her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
speak out and tell him the truth that was troubling
her.</p>

<p>But this <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> was not allowed to last long.</p>

<p>Gerard, jealous himself, had been quick to notice
in the looks of the younger and handsomer Van
Santen the keen admiration of Miss Davison&#8217;s beauty
and grace, which seemed but a natural tribute to her
charms.</p>

<p>Denver came up at a sauntering pace, and with
a glance at Gerard, which was by no means one of
pure benevolence, asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you two old friends now? Is Mr. Buckland
a long-standing acquaintance of yours, Miss
Davison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known him a year, haven&#8217;t I, Mr. Buckland?
Isn&#8217;t is about a year since I first met you at
the Aldingtons&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting on that way now. It was in October.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t treat him as if he was such an old
friend that you haven&#8217;t any eyes for newer ones,
Miss Davison,&#8221; pleaded Denver, in that bluff way
which gave him an air of great honesty and good
nature, but which struck Gerard, at that moment, as
being merely rude and ill-mannered. &#8220;Miss Davison,
I want you to come in and look over my shoulder&mdash;to
bring me luck,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you luck enough to please you this afternoon?&#8221;
asked Gerard, more dryly than was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
civil. &#8220;You seemed to have things all your own way
with Aldington and Gurdon, and the others!&#8221;</p>

<p>Denver, instead of being offended, burst into a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Well then, come now, you
shall take revenge upon me for all the rest of &#8217;em?
Will that do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison came up to them laughing lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Mr. Denver,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t
make Mr. Buckland play cards on Sunday. It&#8217;s
against his principles, I know. He&#8217;s told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denver Van Santen thrust his hands into his
pockets, and turned to Gerard with a jolly look of
incredulous amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, I can&#8217;t quite believe that,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that in this old country
there are still left people, sensible people, who care
a fig what day it is on which they have a good time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that cards are my idea of a good
time,&#8221; said Gerard quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not fond of them,
and I&#8217;ve only played poker once, and that a long time
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you try your luck now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not to-day,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;Aldington
and I have to be getting back to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. You&#8217;ll stay to dinner, won&#8217;t you?
Aldington&#8217;s going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard tried to get hold of Arthur, to persuade
him to leave the Priory without delay. But his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
friend had been too much attracted by Cora Van
Santen to be able to tear himself away so soon, and
they found themselves forced to stay to dinner, which
was fixed on Sunday at the early hour of half-past
six, in order to leave more time for card-playing
afterwards, as Gerard discovered.</p>

<p>When the guests who had stayed to dinner, who
numbered some eight or nine, retired to the drawing-rooms
afterwards, they found there some half-dozen
new arrivals, who had dropped in for the evening.
When Gerard entered the music-room, after dinner,
where he hoped to be allowed to remain, in order to
escape the card-playing, he caught sight of a figure
which he thought was familiar, but which he could
not immediately identify.</p>

<p>It was that of a tall, broad-shouldered young man,
dressed, like most of the others, in dinner coat of
the usual type. He stood a little apart, as if not
quite at home among the others, and Gerard looked
at him two or three times, without being able to recollect
where he had seen him before. He was a rather
silly-looking man with gentle dark eyes, an insignificant
nose, and a black mustache, and he seemed, from
the little which Gerard heard him say, to be as dull
and commonplace a fellow as ever made one of the
background figures at any social gathering.</p>

<p>He talked about the weather, and uttered those important
remarks shyly, as if ashamed of the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
of his own voice; altogether a very dull and uninteresting
person he seemed to be.</p>

<p>Gerard overheard Sir William Gurdon asking one
of the Van Santens who he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I believe his name is Jones, and that&#8217;s
about all I know about him, except that he&#8217;s been
here three times, and hasn&#8217;t opened his mouth more
than twice,&#8221; replied Denver, with a laugh. &#8220;A regular
type of your bullet-headed, stolid Englishman, I
call him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not all so dull as he appears to be,&#8221; retorted
Sir William, as he turned away.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones was so shy that Mrs. Van Santen took
compassion on him, and introduced him to one or two
of the ladies, and in particular to Rachel Davison, to
whom she whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your poor compatriot is so frightened that
you&#8217;d be doing him a kindness if you&#8217;d say something
to him. Tell him it&#8217;s some time since we Americans
were cannibals; but for that matter, if we were still,
I think <i>he&#8217;d</i> be quite safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the good creature led the shy young man up
to Miss Rachel, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Cecil Jones&mdash;Miss Davison.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel smiled and spoke kindly to the poor fellow,
and tried to put him at his ease.</p>

<p>But Gerard was looking at the two spellbound.
For Mr. Jones had had to turn his back to him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
order to make his bow to the lady to whom he was
thus presented. And Gerard, scarcely believing his
eyes, stared at him from this new point of view, and
felt more and more convinced that, though he had
not recognized the dull, sheepish face, he knew the
back view of Mr. Cecil Jones; and that he was no
other than the young man who had beckoned Miss
Davison out of the tea-shop, and who had accompanied
her to and from the police-station, on the day of
the shop-lifting incident at the stores.</p>

<p>Gerard felt stupefied.</p>

<p>What was going to happen? What were these
two here for, pretending to be strangers to each
other, and talking with the air of forced animation
with which people do when they have been newly introduced?</p>

<p>Gerard watched them furtively, and noted other
strange things.</p>

<p>It was not long after dinner when the card-playing
began again, but Mr. Jones excused himself by
saying that he really scarcely knew one card from
another. There was much amusement at this, and
Denver insisted that if he knew nothing about cards
he must learn, and made him choose whether he would
begin with baccarat, poker, or bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; protested the blushing young man, &#8220;it
doesn&#8217;t much matter what I begin with, as I tell you
I know nothing about any one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, they would take no denial, and the unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
young man was thrust into a seat, forced to
take the cards into his hands, and exhibited such
dense ignorance of even the way to hold his cards
that the Van Santens were secretly in fits of laughter
at his expense, which they found it hard to hide.</p>

<p>He obstructed the game by his foolish questions,
betrayed his helplessness and incompetency at every
move, and grew quite angry at his own ill-luck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d always heard,&#8221; he protested ruefully, when he
had lost a couple of sovereigns, the stakes having
been lowered in deference to his incapacity, &#8220;that
beginners generally win. I don&#8217;t seem to, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not venturesome enough,&#8221; said Miss Davison
encouragingly. &#8220;You should play with a little
more daring. Don&#8217;t be timid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take a hand yourself, to give him
courage?&#8221; suggested Denver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at poker. I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, at anything you like. What do you
know? Baccarat? Nap? I don&#8217;t care what it is
as long as it&#8217;s cards,&#8221; said Denver.</p>

<p>Miss Davison consented to sit down and make one
at nap, and, to Gerard&#8217;s uneasiness, she won as much
as the Van Santens did. But still Cecil Jones lost
steadily, until he declared that he had no more money
to play with.</p>

<p>Miss Davison seemed quite delighted at her own
luck, and gathered up her winnings in triumph.</p>

<p>The others congratulated her, and Gerard watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
her as she sailed out of the room and on to the terrace,
with her winnings in her hands to show to Delia
Van Santen.</p>

<p>Delia was the center of a lively group who were
sitting on the terrace in the evening air, laughing
and talking and enjoying themselves more innocently
than the gamblers within.</p>

<p>Cora and Arthur Aldington were sitting apart on
the stone balustrade, and Gerard could see that the
young man was getting every moment more deeply
in love with the graceful songstress.</p>

<p>Miss Davison ran up to Mrs. Van Santen and
showed her winnings with delight; but the old lady
was not pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you
young folks want with so much money, that you
must needs gamble to get it! I should have thought
it was much pleasanter to spend the evening in this
beautiful air than in those hot rooms! And you,
Miss Davison! I&#8217;m surprised at you. I was looking
to you to win Denver from his gaming ways!
He thinks so much of you, and admires you so much!
And now you&#8217;re encouraging him in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady had talked herself out of breath,
while Rachel only laughed and put her winnings in
her purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll cure him,&#8221; she said, &#8220;by winning all his
money and leaving him without any! Won&#8217;t that
do, Mrs. Van Santen?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>And she laughed archly at the gentle old lady, who
shook her head and told her she was every bit as bad
as the boys.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the play went on, sometimes at one
game, and sometimes at another; and the luck varied
a little, but only a little.</p>

<p>Denver Van Santen warned all those who wanted
to play poker with him that they had better not unless
they wanted to lose their money.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll back myself,&#8221; he said quite frankly, &#8220;to
play poker against anybody. Against anybody&mdash;I
don&#8217;t care who it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>And truly enough, although at other games the
luck varied a good deal, it was hopeless to try to get
the better of Denver at his favorite game.</p>

<p>Harry Van Santen, who was a plain, wrinkled
man, with long teeth and a cold, funless smile, played
bridge well, and won for the most part; but his luck
was subject to variations, and when he reckoned up
his fortune at the end of the play, he avowed himself
a loser by two pounds ten.</p>

<p>But Denver pursued a boastful and victorious
course, which remained uncheckered to the end. He
was perfectly candid and honest about his winnings,
reckoned them up openly, and found that he had
made twenty-six pounds during the day. But he
was so swaggeringly triumphant, so carelessly sure
of always retaining the luck he had had that day,
that he irritated some of the men, and got two or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
three promises, among them one from Sir William
Gurdon, that he should not be allowed to win always.
They would come another day and get their own
back.</p>

<p>But Denver, laughing with great good humor, defied
them all.</p>

<p>They might come and play with him whenever
they liked, but they would get a licking, he said.
He flattered himself he knew what he was talking
about. And while he admitted that he was weak in
geography, history, and the use of the globes, he was
ready to bet his bottom dollar that he would hold his
own at his own favorite game till the end of the
chapter.</p>

<p>He grew excited and challenged them to bring to
the Priory any British poker-player alive, and he
would show him a thing or two he, the Britisher,
didn&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>And so, good-humored to the end, but secure and
confident in his victories, Denver saw the guests off,
and stood at the Priory door waving his hand to
the men whom he had made the victims of his skill.</p>

<p>Gerard and Arthur were among the last to leave,
Arthur being unable to tear himself away from
Cora&#8217;s side, and Gerard being very anxious, as he always
was, for just a last word with Miss Davison.</p>

<p>When he got his opportunity, Gerard asked abruptly&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Why did you pretend you&#8217;d never seen Mr.
Jones before this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison opened wide eyes of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Buckland, it&#8217;s very hard to have to
say so, but don&#8217;t you think you are going a little too
far? I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have met Mr. Cecil Jones before, but this
evening you treated him as if he had been a complete
stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>A light came into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know whom you take him for,&#8221; she said
quickly. &#8220;The man you saw me with that day&mdash;the
day when something happened at the stores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; cried he, surprised at her sudden touch
of candor.</p>

<p>She smiled demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that man,&#8221; she said, with a smile of irritating
superior knowledge, &#8220;was not Mr. Jones at
all. I swear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You swear!&#8221; faltered Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;m not at liberty to tell you that man&#8217;s
name, but&mdash;it is not Cecil Jones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard fell back, bewildered and wounded. He
could not bear to face fresh proofs of her duplicity.
But was he mistaken? Or was she forsworn?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last impression left upon Gerard Buckland&#8217;s
mind as he went down the drive with Arthur Aldington
after they had taken leave of the American family
at the Priory, was that of a party of good-humored,
unpretending, easy-mannered people, anxious
to enjoy life and to make those around them
enjoy it also.</p>

<p>The group on the door step of the old Elizabethan
mansion, as seen partly in the moonlight and partly
in the electric light which streamed through the open
door of the house, was a striking and a charming
one.</p>

<p>In the foreground stood the two brothers, Harry,
tall, thin, solemn, and perhaps rather unprepossessing
but not at all behind the rest of the family in the
warmth of his invitation to the departing guests to
come again.</p>

<p>Denver, the younger, broad-shouldered, deep-voiced,
the embodiment of good humor, perhaps
rather addicted to his national vice of boastfulness,
but on the whole too unaffected and straightforward
in manner to be other than pleasing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Santen, the picture of gentle good nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and simplicity, was just behind her sons, with a
hand on the shoulder of the younger, who stood on
the step below her. Her gentle voice could be heard
but faintly as she wished her guests good-bye; but
the gracious, homely figure was good to look upon,
forming as it did a strong amusing contrast to the
elegance of her daughters, and to the luxury of the
house in which they lived.</p>

<p>The daughters were, perhaps, the figures that remained
the longest in the minds of the departing
guests. After the manner of young American
women, they were so amusing, so vivacious, and
withal so quiet in their manners, making their mark
rather by quickness of intellect than by loudness of
voice, that it was impossible to think of them without
recalling the pleasure their accomplishments and
graces had given.</p>

<p>Delia, the elder, was the perfection of grace, and
wore her plainly made but well-chosen clothes with
a distinction which a princess might have envied.
Without being very handsome, she was so lively, so
full of repartee and resource in argument, and so active
and alert in passing from group to group among
her mother&#8217;s guests, assuring herself that all were enjoying
themselves, and that they were in congenial
society, that she might have been called the leading
spirit of the family, and was undoubtedly the pivot
on which their social scheme turned.</p>

<p>She it was who knew when to take a guest, sore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
over his losses at poker, into the garden to enjoy conversation
under the trees in the soothing society of
the old lady, or into the music-room to be coaxed
back into good humor by the sweet singing of her
sister Cora.</p>

<p>As for Cora, her musical gifts never failed to evoke
the remark that it was a pity she was not a professional
singer, for such rare sweetness of voice as she
possessed ought to have been given to a wider circle
than any amateur can appeal to.</p>

<p>But when anyone said this, the brothers would look
rather offended, and would say shortly that it might
have been all very well for Cora if she had been poor,
to earn her living on the concert platform, but that
they could never think of allowing their sister, who
had and would always have, every luxury she could
wish for provided for her, to appear in public. If
her voice was charming, let her use it for the pleasure
of her friends.</p>

<p>Personally, then, Gerard had no fault to find with
any of the family. He might like some members of
it better than the others, he might disapprove of the
tastes and habits which seemed to him to indicate both
want of consideration for their visitors and lack of
those qualities which make men lifelong friends. To
spend so many hours at cards was revolting to the
young Englishman, and his principles and prejudices
alike made the spending of Sunday in this manner
distasteful to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>But this alone would have roused in him no suspicion
that there was anything wrong about these hospitable
strangers. Many an English household that
he knew of spent Sunday in much the same way, and
incurred no suspicion of there being anything worse
than a tendency to dissipation on the part of its members.</p>

<p>Racing ladies like Lady Sylvia and the Marchioness
were known to play bridge on most days, and
yet they were not &#8220;cut&#8221; by their acquaintances and
friends.</p>

<p>It was the fact that he had met Rachel Davison
at the Priory which filled Gerard with disquietude.
For, whatever might be the truth about her, it was
undeniable that he had so far never failed to find
her connected in some more or less close way with
things that had been better undone.</p>

<p>The incident in the crowd on the night of the ball;
the affair at the stores; her deceit towards her mother
and Lady Jennings; all these things combined to
make it impossible to see in this fresh phase of Rachel&#8217;s
existence anything but some new form of trickery
or ugly mystery.</p>

<p>To have seen her sit down to play cards with these
Americans, therefore, would alone have made him
curious concerning them; but, coupled with the fact
that both she and the Van Santens had pretended not
to know the man Jones, her playing became at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
suggestive to Gerard&#8217;s unwilling mind of something
being wrong with the play.</p>

<p>What he would have passed without remark at any
other time, therefore, now became a source of disturbance
and uneasiness to him; and instead of taking
for granted that Denver&#8217;s estimate of his gains
that day was correct, he made a little sum for himself,
based on what he had heard, in answer to his inquiries,
concerning the luck of the rest of the card-players.</p>

<p>And the result of his calculations was to find that,
instead of Denver&#8217;s having won twenty-six pounds,
which was his own rough estimate of his winnings, he
must have netted at least two hundred pounds.</p>

<p>From this calculation it was easy to go on to
others; and to say that, if Denver played poker once
a week only, and if he were always as lucky and as
skillful as he had shown himself that day, then his annual
income derived from the cards alone must be
something approaching ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Of course he had no possible means of knowing
whether Denver did play poker every Sunday; and
whether he invariably won at it; but, taking the facts
that he knew in conjunction with Miss Davison&#8217;s
presence, and with the singular fact that she and the
others pretended not to know Jones, who was clearly
acting as a decoy, it seemed to Gerard terribly difficult
to get away from the conclusion that something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
was wrong in the pleasant and hospitable household,
and that Rachel Davison was mixed up in it.</p>

<p>And now she had deliberately told him a lie! He
tried in vain to avoid coming to this conclusion, but
in the face of her denial that Cecil Jones was identical
with the man he had seen in her company more
than once, he could not believe her. Although to-day
was the first occasion on which he had seen the
young man&#8217;s face, Gerard had so carefully made
a mental note of his figure and gait, that he was sure
he could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>Arthur Aldington, who was his own chauffeur, was
driving slowly and carefully down the drive when
suddenly he stopped the motor-car, and looking out
into the road towards which he was going, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! There&#8217;s a breakdown, and it&#8217;s Sir
William Gurdon&#8217;s big car in difficulties, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard jumped out and went down the drive to
the gate, which had been left open.</p>

<p>Looking down the road he saw that Arthur was
right: the big, handsome car which had brought the
baronet over from his Thames-side villa was blocking
the road, and beside it were three persons: Sir William,
his chauffeur, and Cecil Jones, whom the baronet
had offered to take back to town with him, which
he could easily do, as he proposed to spend the night
in the city himself.</p>

<p>Gerard went back to Arthur, told him he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
right, and jumping into the car again, turned and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir William&#8217;s got that fellow Jones with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur had not yet started the car, and he said in
a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the look of Jones. He&#8217;s such an
awful ass! I don&#8217;t want to have to take him with
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t suppose we shall have to do that.
We don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong. Something very
trifling, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Arthur hesitated. He was in a very ill humor,
on account of his losses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it doesn&#8217;t matter to him how much
money he loses,&#8221; he said, in a grumbling tone; &#8220;he
looks that sort of chap, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard hesitated. He had in his mind the notion
that Cecil Jones, simple as he looked and sillily as he
spoke, was not quite the innocent jay he appeared.
But yet he did not want to betray a suspicion of these
new friends of Rachel Davison&#8217;s until he was quite
sure about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he lose much?&#8221; asked Gerard, instead of replying
to his friend&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know. I saw a good deal of gold
flying about, and he said, with that sheepish smile of
his, that he&#8217;d been cleaned out. I wonder Miss Davison
cares to stay with people who play cards all day
on Sunday!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;Well, it surprised me to see her playing, too,&#8221;
admitted Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I shan&#8217;t say anything about that at home.
Mother would be awfully disgusted. And I can&#8217;t
say I quite like it myself; and I know I don&#8217;t like
losing so much as I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you go on playing, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you know one can&#8217;t help oneself. These
people are rich, and they don&#8217;t consider that other
pockets are not all as deep as their own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they really so rich?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Of course I know everybody in America
is called a millionaire if he has a little money put
by. But the father, old Van Santen, really is a very
rich man, as I happen to know, and a man with a decent
character, as rich men&#8217;s characters go out there.
He&#8217;s expected over here every day, and I fancy he&#8217;ll
be rather surprised, if all I hear about his rather
straight-laced views is correct, at the way in which
his quiet family has transformed itself into a remarkably
lively one. Denver says they&#8217;ve all been kept in
with too tight a hand, and that now they have to
make up for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand that fellow,&#8221; said
Gerard. &#8220;He&#8217;s not consistent. I heard him telling
Sir William that he sometimes lost at poker to
beginners at the game. But then, later, he was
boasting that he could beat any poker-player in
England.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe,&#8221; said Arthur viciously, &#8220;that
he plays merely for the pleasure of the game, as he
says. I believe he&#8217;s trying to make a pile for himself,
in case his father, when he turns up, should object
to the way they&#8217;ve been going on, and cut off
supplies.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a good suggestion, and Gerard muttered,
&#8220;By Jove!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t mean to suggest,&#8221; went on
Arthur hastily, &#8220;that there&#8217;s anything fishy about
his play. Only that he isn&#8217;t indifferent to what he
makes by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that too,&#8221; assented Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;But pray don&#8217;t say I made any suggestion of
the sort,&#8221; added Arthur. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like the girls
to hear that I had said anything they wouldn&#8217;t like
to hear about their brother. And indeed I don&#8217;t
know that I have any right to say what I did to you;
but I&#8217;m rather sore at having been fool enough to
lose more money than I can afford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; suggested Gerard tentatively, &#8220;if
you suspect the one you must suspect the rest, and
surely you don&#8217;t think the ladies&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur interrupted quite fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suspect anybody. I never said such a
thing,&#8221; he said irritably. &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s all right.
But what I meant was that I don&#8217;t like American men
and their ways and habits and tastes, so well as I like
the feminine part of the nation. The daughters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
are charming, perfectly charming, and the old lady
is quite a treat in her refreshing innocence. The
sight of that quaint New England&mdash;it is New England,
isn&#8217;t it, that the quaint old figures come from?&mdash;New
England figure among all those smart young
modern men and women, is something one can&#8217;t forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right,&#8221; said Gerard enthusiastically.
&#8220;She&#8217;s an old dear, with her skimpy little
shawl, and what I&#8217;m sure she would call her best
taffety petticoat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two young men laughed, and, as there was no
sign of a forward movement in the big car, Arthur
started his motor, and soon arrived at the spot where
the group stood round the disabled machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo! A breakdown! Anything we can do?&#8221;
asked Arthur, as he stopped and got down.</p>

<p>Sir William was not at all pleased at his mishap,
and he answered rather shortly that there was nothing
much the matter, and that if the small car were
to go on, he would soon overtake it.</p>

<p>The artless-looking Cecil Jones was smoking a
cigarette with the same placid smile on his face
which had irritated Arthur Aldington at the card-table.
He made weak suggestions as to the cause
of the mishap, and was treated by the others as a
person who did not count.</p>

<p>Gerard, however, who had reason to suspect that
he was not quite so simple as he pretended to be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
went up to him, and, seizing a moment when the
others were all bending down to look into the machinery
of the disabled car, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve met you before, Mr. Jones, and
I&#8217;m trying to remember where it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man turned, with his sheepish smile
on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember you.
Where was it we met?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard felt irritated and angry. He knew that
this man was either a swindler who was working with
Miss Davison in the dubious paths he suspected, or
else that he was a man who was desperately in love
with her, and whom she had twisted round her little
finger, so that he did what she told him to without
question, if not without suspicion.</p>

<p>To judge by his silly face, this latter was the
more likely supposition of the two.</p>

<p>Gerard tried to take him by surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it outside Lord Chislehurst&#8217;s house, on the
night of the great ball he gave a year ago?&#8221; he
asked sharply.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of confusion or intelligence
on Cecil Jones&#8217; face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Chislehurst&#8217;s!&#8221; he echoed stupidly. &#8220;A
year ago! I don&#8217;t know where Lord Chislehurst&#8217;s is.
And I don&#8217;t think I was in England a year ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frustrated, Gerard decided to make a fresh attempt
to take him by surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;I daresay I&#8217;m wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very
good at remembering faces. But you do remind me
of a man I met a few days ago, coming out of a
police-station.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words could be taken as insulting, but Cecil
Jones was impervious to insult.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been in a police-station,&#8221;
he said simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with Miss Davison?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil Jones turned round so that he could stare
blankly into his questioner&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison!&#8221; echoed he. &#8220;Do you mean the
lady I was introduced to to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Gerard shortly.</p>

<p>A broad stupid smile spread over the young man&#8217;s
plump face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy thinking I should meet a smart lady like
that in a police-station!&#8221; he said buoyantly. &#8220;It
sounds like the game of consequences. &#8216;Where they
met&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;In a police-station.&#8217; &#8216;What they were
doing&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Picking pockets!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And he burst into such a long and silly laugh
that Gerard, irritated almost beyond endurance, did
not dare to go on with his questions, for fear of
drawing down upon them the attention of the others,
who turned round to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>But Gerard was more convinced than ever that
this innocent-looking young man was a person to be
watched; and, resolved to see what became of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
that night, he found an opportunity of asking Sir
William where he was going to set his companion
down.</p>

<p>The baronet named a well-known sporting club.</p>

<p>Arthur Aldington was calling Gerard to get into
his car, and in a few minutes they were on the road
again.</p>

<p>Gerard had made his plans, and, as his friend had
offered to take him back to his chambers in town, he
could reckon upon being in time for what he wanted
to do, if only the big car were delayed sufficiently to
give the little one a good start.</p>

<p>Things turned out as he wished. He and Arthur
got to town before Sir William; and Gerard went
straight to the neighborhood of the club where Cecil
Jones was to be set down, and was able to conceal
himself in the entrance of a block of flats on the
opposite side of the road.</p>

<p>Here he waited for nearly half an hour, afraid he
had missed his man.</p>

<p>At last, however, he saw Sir William Gurdon&#8217;s big
motor-car coming up the street, and a few moments
later it stopped at the door of the club, and Cecil
Jones got out, shook hands with Sir William, and
went into the building.</p>

<p>The motor-car drove away, and Gerard remained
on the watch. Not for more than half an hour, for
at the end of that time Cecil Jones came out of the
club building, and hailing a hansom, got in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
drove off, giving a direction to the cabman which
Gerard could not hear.</p>

<p>But he was far too much interested in what became
of Jones to let the matter rest like that. So he hailed
a hansom in his turn, told the driver to follow the
vehicle before him, and continued the chase until
Jones&#8217; hansom stopped in one of the streets off Charing
Cross Road. Here Cecil Jones got out, paid the
cabman, and disappeared from sight most mysteriously.</p>

<p>Although Gerard was watching keenly, he was unable
to tell exactly at what point his quarry had
disappeared. The street was rather dark at this
point, and there was a court, as well as the openings
into doorways, to be examined.</p>

<p>Cecil Jones&#8217; hansom drove away, and Gerard paid
his own cabman and got down to continue his pursuit
on foot, but in vain. Jones had disappeared as
completely as if the earth had swallowed him up.</p>

<p>Gerard looked upon this circumstance as not
merely suspicious, but as confirming his own belief
that Jones, instead of being the innocent and mild-eyed
victim of expert gamesters that he had pretended
to be, was really a confederate of these Americans,
if they were swindlers, or a swindler who intended,
in the future, to make money out of the
boastful Denver, and who began by posing as a
harmless dupe or beginner, in order to take the
American off his guard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Gerard did not think the Van Santens were cheats;
their father being a man of good repute, as well as
of great wealth, it was scarcely likely, even if his sons
had turned out loose-principled, that they would take
to dubious courses which would endanger their position
in society. The sons of such a woman as the
gentle Mrs. Van Santen, too, were scarcely the sort
of persons to be accused of deliberate fraud.</p>

<p>But that the younger made money by his card-playing,
and that he boasted of the fact was obvious;
and Gerard thought that such a man might very
easily become the prey of a clever card-sharper, who
might begin by passing himself off as a bungling
novice, and end by making considerable sums out of
the swaggering American.</p>

<p>This was the view he was most inclined to take.
Not for one moment did he believe that the mild-eyed
Jones was really a victim: he was confident that he
had been with Miss Davison on the occasion of the
shop-lifting, and he began now to ask himself
whether he were not the very man to whom he had
seen her handing the flashing ornament on the night
of Lord Chislehurst&#8217;s ball.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were both under the influence of the
man in the white mustache. Or perhaps&mdash;but this
he scarcely believed possible&mdash;Cecil Jones was no
other than the military-looking man under a disguise.</p>

<p>As this last suggestion came into his mind, Gerard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
tried to recall the voice of the white-haired man,
whom he had heard utter a few words to Miss Davison
before parting with her at the station.</p>

<p>But on that occasion it was Rachel who had spoken
clearly enough to be heard, while the man had so
subdued his voice that Gerard could just hear him
speaking, without being able to make out what he
said. Such a remembrance as he retained therefore
of the sound of the elderly gentleman&#8217;s voice Gerard
could not rely upon as a help in his present difficulty.</p>

<p>One thing, and one thing only he was quite sure of,
Cecil Jones, instead of being the dupe he pretended
to be, was a swindler, and a very artful one. Nothing
else would explain his conduct adequately. Only
a swindler, or a man used to the arts of concealment,
would have contrived so often to be seen without being
well seen. Only a man who had something to
conceal would have affected not to know Miss Davison,
when, as a matter of fact, he must be on terms
of old acquaintance with her. And only a very
clever man could have succeeded so well in feigning
absolute stupidity over the cards as he had done.</p>

<p>Last and most important thing of all, Gerard was
convinced that, carefully as he had concealed himself
while watching Jones, that astute person must have
seen him and must have laid his plans well in order
to throw his pursuer off the track.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, and not knowing whether he now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
hated Miss Davison for her duplicity and her obvious
association with undesirable persons, or
whether he retained his old longing to believe in her
in spite of everything, Gerard went back to his
rooms.</p>

<p>He went to sleep that night upon a firm resolve to
have no more to do with Rachel Davison if he could
help it; not to put himself in her way again, and
not to visit Lady Jennings until that lady had forgotten
her late friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, and interested
herself in someone else.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> was very greatly assisted in this determination
by the fact that he had received an invitation
to spend the month of August and the beginning of
September with his uncle in Norfolk. And although
it cannot be said that he succeeded in forgetting
Miss Davison while he was away, yet in the enjoyment
of his holiday he was able to believe that he had
cured himself of what he was ready to call his infatuation
about a girl whom he could not but look
upon as better forgotten.</p>

<p>Again and again he argued with himself, trying
to find out some possible reason for her conduct
compatible with her being as honorable and noble a
woman as he had at first supposed.</p>

<p>But stern facts stood in the way on all sides, and
he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that
the less he thought about her the better it would be
for his peace of mind.</p>

<p>And then, after six weeks of pleasant country life,
disturbed indeed now and then by recollections of
Rachel, and vague longings to see her again and to
probe the mysterious depths of her wayward nature,
he returned to town, and straightway fell deeper
into the toils than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>It happened in this way. Gerard was with a
party of his country friends and relations at the
Earl&#8217;s Court Exhibition one evening, and had just
finished dining with them at one of the restaurants,
when, as he smoked a cigarette by himself outside,
he caught sight of Rachel Davison and Denver Van
Santen, walking slowly together. The young man
was talking very earnestly, and bending down to look
into her face, while Rachel, as far as Gerard could see,
was listening to him without displeasure.</p>

<p>In an instant all his good resolutions, his wise
resignation, disappeared. He was filled with the
maddest jealousy of the handsome American; and
no amount of philosophical sneers at women availed
him when he looked at the girl who, after an absence
of six weeks, seemed to him ten times handsomer
than she had ever looked before.</p>

<p>Her black dress, of some clinging material, richly
embroidered with black chenille and jet, had long
sleeves and a vest of tucked chiffon of the palest
pink; and her large black hat, trimmed with a cluster
of black ostrich tips and with one pale pink rose
under the brim, suited her handsome face to perfection.</p>

<p>A cape of some soft black material, lined with
tucked pink chiffon, completed her costume, which,
as usual with her, was carefully studied down to the
well-cut, high-heeled black shoes and black silk stockings,
and the glimpse of a pale pink underskirt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
trimmed with chiffon of the same color that was
shown as she held up her dress.</p>

<p>In vain Gerard told himself that he was glad to
have seen her with Denver Van Santen, that now he
could go his way with an easy mind, secure in the
knowledge that Rachel Davison was merely a friend
and accomplice of thieves, shop-lifters, and other undesirable
persons, and that the very fact of her allowing
herself to be made love to by this swaggering
gamester proved conclusively how unfit she was to
be loved by any honest man.</p>

<p>The fiercer he grew as he told himself these things,
the more savagely he watched the two as they sauntered
among the people, and at last joined a large
group, among whom Gerard recognized the pale
face and simple gray silk gown of Cora Van Santen,
and the homely features of her mother, who, good
soul, looked more out of place than ever, in her old-fashioned
large bonnet and heavy dolman, among the
crowds of well-dressed women around her.</p>

<p>As before at the Priory, the family was surrounded
by smart English people, of whom Gerard
recognized two or three. One was Sir William Gurdon,
who was talking eagerly to Delia, and another
was Arthur Aldington, who could not tear himself
away from Cora.</p>

<p>Gerard watched them from a distance, but did not
go near them.</p>

<p>He saw that Denver could not leave Rachel&#8217;s side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and that she, instead of resenting his persistent attentions,
appeared to be encouraging him.</p>

<p>But the firmness with which he told himself that
he was glad, and that now he could whistle her off
and leave her to her undesirable friends, soon left
him; and on the very first opportunity, when he saw
Rachel for a moment on the outside of the crowd
formed by the Americans and their friends, he
pounced upon her, and suddenly presenting himself
like a brigand rather than a casually met friend,
said between his clenched teeth&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must speak to you. I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He expected to be snubbed, to be dismissed more
or less coldly; but, to his surprise, Rachel turned
very white, as she always did when excited, and then
flushed a little, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. We can come back to Mrs. Van Santen
afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked away with him at a rapid pace, so that
they were soon lost to the sight of her friends, and
mingling in the general crowd.</p>

<p>The night was fine and warm, and the gardens
were full. It was without the slightest difficulty that
they got the opportunity Gerard wanted, of speaking
to her from the depths of his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you let that fellow talk to you? Do
you care for him?&#8221; he asked, conscious as he spoke
that he was using a tone which, considering all the
circumstances, was as unjustifiable as it was absurd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help his talking to me, Mr. Buckland.
I was staying with his people before I went abroad
with my mother, and I am visiting them again
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you care for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like them all; and as for Mr. Denver, he wants
me to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To marry him! And you are going to?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t given him any answer yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I know I have no right to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was trembling, and trying hard to speak in a
quiet and cool tone. He was conscious that, if his
suspicions of her were well founded, there was nothing
in the least extraordinary in her marrying the
swaggering American, who, for that matter, was
certainly what would have been called a good match,
since he was the son of a rich man.</p>

<p>But the puzzle of the matter was that, knowing
all that he knew, and suspecting all that he suspected,
Gerard felt that she was too good to throw
herself away upon this fellow, whom he believed to
be guilty of winning money from his guests, at least
by dint of superior skill with the cards, if not by
something less creditable.</p>

<p>Away from her he might and did believe in the
possibility of her complicity in crime; when in her
presence he felt again that she was incapable of anything
dishonorable or criminal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Rachel drew a soft little sigh, which disarmed him
completely. If he had thought her capable of
deceit, of guilt a moment before, that sigh made him
feel ashamed of such thoughts. He turned to her
quickly. They were in a dark part of the gardens,
where, standing beside her, with his face away from
the light, he could speak at his ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you care for
this fellow; I don&#8217;t believe you would marry him.
Will you marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>As had happened more than once before, the sudden
betrayal of his tenderness softened and unnerved
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how can you ask me?&#8221; she burst out, in a
hoarse whisper. &#8220;Thinking as you do of me, why
do you do it? It&#8217;s impossible that you can care for
me, impossible that you mean what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words, as she uttered them, sent shock after
shock through him. At one moment her heart-rending
tones made him feel smitten with remorse for
doubting her; the next, a sort of shame, of humiliation
in her voice revived his worst fears. He stood
silent beside her for a space, unable to reply.</p>

<p>A smothered sob from her loosened his tongue.
Keeping quite still, so that a person might have
passed close to them without noticing how vital was
the subject of their conversation, how deeply moved
they both were, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know what I think? Isn&#8217;t it enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
for you that I tell you I love you, that I ask you
to be my wife? Rachel you are miserable. You
go and stay with these people, but you don&#8217;t care
for them; you listen to this man, but you don&#8217;t like
him, you never could like him. Why do you pretend
to? Don&#8217;t tell me you mean to marry him: I know
better. You don&#8217;t love him, and you don&#8217;t trust
him: you can&#8217;t. But you&#8217;ve sometimes spoken, to
me and to others, as if you did care a little for me.
Won&#8217;t you give up this feverish, miserable life that
you are leading? Won&#8217;t you be my wife, and rest
and forget it all? You won&#8217;t make so much money
as you are doing now. You won&#8217;t be able for a time
at any rate, to wear such beautiful dresses as you
do now; but you would be happier. I&#8217;m not very
poor, and I love you, in spite of myself, in spite of&mdash;everything.
Will you give it all up, and give up
these dubious American people, and learn to be
happy? I could teach you, Rachel, you know I
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was moved, as she so easily was by his
passionate attempts to solve the mystery of her
life.</p>

<p>But she kept her self-control, and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me,&#8221; she said, in a tremulous whisper;
&#8220;it&#8217;s of no use. I can only say one thing: no, no,
no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why must you say that, if you feel that you
would like to say something else, Rachel? Listen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
I know you are acting under orders. I know you
are leading a life you hate, and that you are doing
it because you are under the influence of a will
stronger than your own. I know that you wish you
could break away from it, that you would give the
world to be free. And I know that something
stronger than yourself holds you down and binds
you, and forces you into ways that torture you, and
into a life that is a living tomb for all that is best
in you. Rachel, Rachel, tear yourself away from it&mdash;break
loose; say you will be free, and with my
help you will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words had the most extraordinary effect upon
the girl. At the first mention of the superior power
that held her in bondage, a violent convulsion seemed
to pass through her frame, and though she uttered
no sound, he knew that the unexpected blow had
struck home. Then she listened rigidly to the rest
of his passionate speech, seeming to drink in his
words with avidity, to find some painful, piteous
pleasure in the expression of his belief, his entreaties.
When he had let his voice die away and was waiting
for her answer, she did not look at him, but he could
hear her drawing her breath as if with difficulty, and
he knew that she was going through a great, a pitiful
struggle with herself.</p>

<p>He whispered again&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel, won&#8217;t you do it? Won&#8217;t you get free,
and be my wife?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Then she turned a startled face towards him in
the half-darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t marry you, Mr. Buckland,&#8221; she said
tremulously. &#8220;I don&#8217;t deny I&#8217;m gratified by the
feeling you have for me, though I know I don&#8217;t a
bit deserve it. Believe me, you would be miserable
if I were to listen to you: I can imagine nothing
more terrible for you than to have a wife like me,
with a capricious and headstrong temper, and a will
that leads her into all sorts of ways which she would
perhaps have done better to avoid. So I thank you,
but I can only give you one answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came a little nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;think again. Think it all
over quietly&mdash;to-night&mdash;by yourself, and then
answer me afterwards. Think whether you would
not rather give up the life that makes you miserable,
for the life which would make you happy. Don&#8217;t
answer me now; think it over first. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated. This proud, headstrong girl was
always easily moved as a child when once he touched
the right chord, as he seemed to be able to do at
will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I will,&#8221; she said, in a timid tone, like
a very, very young girl confronted by a difficult
choice; &#8220;but I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of anything yet. Weigh what
I&#8217;ve said against what others say, and decide which
offers you the best chance of happiness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>There was a short silence, Rachel trembling and
not looking at him, he watching her with tender, imploring
eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly there appeared between them the figure
of Denver Van Santen, and Gerard started back a
step with a shock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear girl,&#8221; said the swaggering American,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what had become of you. Did
you mean to give me the slip?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he offered her his arm with an air
of confident devotion which nettled Gerard immensely.</p>

<p>And without so much as a glance at the timid, passionate
English lover, whose look and attitude were
eloquently expressive of his feelings, Miss Davison
put her hand caressingly through Denver&#8217;s proffered
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, in a very much
more openly affectionate tone than she had ever used
to Gerard. &#8220;How could you think I would do such
a thing, Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>Raising his hat mechanically, Gerard stepped back,
with a look on his face as if he had been stabbed
to the heart.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw
how completely Miss Davison appeared to have forgotten
his very existence the moment the American
came up.</p>

<p>Denver, on his side, treated his rival as if he had
never seen him before. Gerard thought, indeed, that
the young American had perhaps failed to recognize
him. For neither he nor Rachel had been speaking
for some moments when they were startled by the
figure appearing between them.</p>

<p>But that Miss Davison should behave with such
marked incivility puzzled and bewildered him. Not
the usual gracious smile and bow of farewell did she
vouchsafe him as she walked away, listening amiably
to the eager talk of the American, smiling in answer
to his remarks, and behaving exactly as if she were
enjoying his society to the utmost.</p>

<p>Gerard wondered what it meant. Was she a
coquette? She had never given the least sign of it
with him, having always been straightforward even
in her reticence, not pretending that there was no
mystery in her way of life, but treating it as one
that she could not clear up, and that she wished him
to leave unsolved also.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Now, however, she was certainly behaving as if
she were encouraging the young American; she was
animated, charming, sweet, and she was evidently
aware that he was fascinated, and pleased by the
fact.</p>

<p>Yet she had but a moment before been touched,
tender, serious, moved by Gerard&#8217;s emotion, and
ready to consent to think over the passionate avowal
which he had made.</p>

<p>Now it looked as if she had never had a serious
thought in her life. Gerard could hear her rippling
laugh, could see the lively movements of her hand
and head, which showed that she was talking as
eagerly to Denver as he to her.</p>

<p>He watched them until they had almost disappeared,
and then he suddenly set his teeth and resolved
not to be thrown off in this manner. He
would follow them, go up to the group of which
they formed part, join them and the rest of the Van
Santens, and find out, if he could, whether Denver
was looked upon as the accepted lover he certainly
appeared to think himself.</p>

<p>He knew very well, as he approached the group
of which the primly dressed and gentle old New England
woman formed the center, that he was very foolish
to come so near the candle, and that he was
risking the singeing of his wings. But Miss Davison&#8217;s
attraction for him was stronger than his prudence,
and a few moments after she had gone away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
with Denver, Gerard found himself talking to old
Mrs. Van Santen, and listening to Cora and Arthur
Aldington as they flirted merrily on one side of him,
and to Miss Davison and Denver, as they talked
eagerly and apparently with great seriousness, on the
other.</p>

<p>Delia Van Santen, watchful and tactful as ever,
was the least talkative of the party, over whom she
kept a watchful eye, ever ready to avert discord and
to put in a pleasant word if disputes threatened or
if conversation languished.</p>

<p>Only one member of the family was missing: this
was Harry Van Santen, the elder brother, and in
Gerard&#8217;s opinion, by far the least prepossessing
member of the family. He was at his club, the
others explained; and nobody appeared to miss
him.</p>

<p>Miss Davison did not turn once in Gerard&#8217;s direction,
or appear conscious that he had joined the
party. She seemed to have eyes for no one but
Denver, and it was impossible to doubt that, so far
from being disposed to resent the attentions of the
young American, she was doing her best to attract
him, and succeeding perfectly in the attempt.</p>

<p>Nobody indeed appeared to have the least doubt
of what was going on; and Arthur Aldington, during
one of the rare intervals when he was not engrossed
with Cora, laughed as he looked in the direction
of the two, and remarked to Gerard that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
was little doubt that America was going to carry off
one of our English beauties.</p>

<p>Gerard could not control all show of his indignation
at the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s only flirting with him,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Arthur laughed dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than that, I think, and so do the rest
of the family. Ask Mrs. Van Santen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed the old lady had been beaming benevolently
upon the young people for some time, as Gerard
knew. And the knowledge that Rachel was thus
openly avowing her preference for and encouragement
of the man whom he considered a &#8220;bounder&#8221;
oppressed and irritated him in equal degree.</p>

<p>In vain he struggled against his uneasiness, his
anger. And at last, afraid of trusting himself
among the sharp eyes which could, he did not doubt,
fathom the distress he was suffering, he withdrew
from the party, and rejoined his own.</p>

<p>But the evening was heavy and gloomy for him,
and he felt that his very presence was casting depression
over his friends, so he presently excused himself,
and leaving them, was hurrying out of the
grounds, when he chanced to catch sight of the
Americans once more, and saw Rachel, still with Denver
in close attendance, but with a look in her eyes
which he recognized as no longer one of idle amusement,
but of acute anxiety.</p>

<p>A moment later, as he was close to the gates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
he felt a touch on his arm, and looking round, found
Arthur Aldington beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Buckland, Miss Davison sent me
to say she would like to speak to you before you go
away. If you&#8217;ll wait near the seat by the trees
over there, she&#8217;ll find an opportunity of escaping,
and I&#8217;ll bring her there myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t be able to get rid of that Van Santen,&#8221;
said he sullenly, as he glanced behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust a woman&mdash;especially a woman like
Rachel&mdash;for getting rid of anyone she wants to
get rid of,&#8221; said Arthur. &#8220;And really my own
opinion is that it would be an awful thing for her
if she were to think seriously of that bounder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard echoed the word inquiringly.</p>

<p>Arthur nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men don&#8217;t like the fellow,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;He&#8217;s
too noisy, too&mdash;too overbearing; too much side and
too much swagger. It&#8217;s amazing to everybody that
a well-bred woman like Miss Davison should put up
with him for a moment. It&#8217;s the money, I suppose.
Well, will you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard nodded silently. It was of no use to try
to be wise where Rachel was concerned. He could
only hope to escape being utterly foolish, and without
much prospect of success.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he was waiting at the appointed
spot, and in another two minutes Rachel herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
with Arthur Aldington, came up and met him there.
Arthur disappeared with a few words from Rachel,
who arranged that he should fetch her in ten minutes
and take her back to the Van Santens, and then she
and Gerard were once more alone together.</p>

<p>The change in her was so sudden, so great, that
he could scarcely believe his eyes. Every trace of
the brilliant manner, of the laughing face, the light,
easy manner, the slight affectation, which had distinguished
her tone and manner but half an hour ago,
when she was with Denver and among the rest, had
disappeared, and given place to a demeanor touching
in its grave sadness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Buckland,&#8221; she began quite simply, as soon
as Arthur was out of earshot, &#8220;you must think me
a strange creature, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think of you,&#8221; he replied
desperately. &#8220;You seem to be, not one or two, but
half a dozen women; and they&#8217;re all charming,
though some of them&mdash;might well break a man&#8217;s
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to break yours, or any man&#8217;s,&#8221;
she said simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must break mine or Van Santen&#8217;s,&#8221; he said
dryly, &#8220;if you go on acting as you&#8217;ve done this
evening, being one woman, and a very sweet though
puzzling one, to me, and quite another, a brilliant,
charming one, to him. How am I to believe that you
like one of us better than the other? You were certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
doing your best to make him think he was the
man you liked. I don&#8217;t want you to make a fool
of me like that. I can&#8217;t deny that you could if you
wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to tell you I like you,&#8221; she said
gently. &#8220;You are welcome, if you wish, to believe
I don&#8217;t care in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I&#8217;d rather you should pretend you cared
for me&mdash;at least, I think I&#8217;d rather!&#8221; stammered
poor Gerard, who was struggling against the impulse
to yield himself wholly to the personal fascination
she exercised over him.</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily, but with eyes so mournful,
so full of some deep-seated distress, that he was
seized by an overpowering desire to know what the
secret was which made her such a tantalizing, maddening
mystery. Why was she so sweet to him, after
having been but a short time before in his very presence,
just as irresistible, in a wholly different fashion,
to another man?</p>

<p>Was she a coquette, after all? Was she only trying
to show her power, by bringing to her feet a
man whom she had recently disgusted by her open
encouragement of another?</p>

<p>Miss Davison read his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t pretend&mdash;to you,&#8221; she said simply. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t tell you I care for you. You can think, if you
like, that I like someone else better.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t like to think so!&#8221; burst out poor
Gerard.</p>

<p>She went on imperturbably.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may think, if you like, that, overpowered,
dazzled by the thought of marrying a rich man, and
being out of reach of poverty, and saved from the
necessity of hard and distasteful work any longer, I
have decided to encourage the attentions of a man
who is deeply in love with me, and who could undoubtedly
enable me, if I married him, to live an
easy and leisurely life. You may think, if you like,
that I am quite at liberty to do this, and that it is
the wisest thing I could do. You may think, too,
if you please, that this rich man is not exactly the
sort of man I should have chosen if I had been quite
free to choose, but that, not being quite free, I was
justified in encouraging, and in accepting him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are you sure he is rich, and that he is not
merely dependent upon the pleasure or caprice of
a father who may, or may not, approve of him and
intend to leave him well off?&#8221; argued poor Gerard
earnestly. &#8220;Miss Davison, believe me, I wouldn&#8217;t
be selfish and mean enough to say a word against this
young Van Santen if I could think him worthy of
you. Believe me, though I own I&#8217;m jealous of him,
I wouldn&#8217;t show unworthy or despicable jealousy of
him or of any man. But it has occurred to me to
doubt whether he is the sort of man you ought to
trust yourself with. And I should like, if I may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
dare, to beg you not to definitely give your promise
to marry him until his father has arrived in England,
and until you&#8217;ve made sure that the young ones are
really going to be well off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to make sure of my bargain
then, before I sign?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered he steadily, &#8220;I do. I know I&#8217;m
jealous: I own it. I think this Denver Van Santen
is not good enough for you. But I understand your
point of view, and I sympathize with you; and therefore,
I say, if as I suppose, you propose to marry
this man, not because you care particularly about
him, but because he is well off and can make life
easier for you, do not be in too great a hurry over it:
make sure, before you promise, that the other side
is in a situation to bring to the bargain all you expect
of it. It sounds a cold-blooded way of speaking,
I know, but, believe me, coldness is the last
thing you need accuse me of where <i>you</i> are concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison listened with the same air of profound
and serious interest that she had given to him
earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;Then
whatever happens, I shall take your advice, and I
shan&#8217;t definitely accept Denver until I&#8217;ve seen his
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard assented eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I meant,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;If
old Van Santen, whom everybody seems to speak well
of, should agree to the match, and if you should like
him and get on well with him, then I say you might
have a chance of happiness with the son; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard looked up, half shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would become me to say any
more,&#8221; he said frankly, &#8220;considering, as I&#8217;ve told
you, that I&#8217;m jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a faint smile flickered over Rachel&#8217;s face,
then, in a sweet, low voice, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like you to be jealous, Mr. Buckland.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he burst out passionately&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t. You have no right to use me like this,
no right to send for me to talk about your intended
marriage with another man, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;to
try&mdash;to try&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To try to make you see that I&#8217;m grateful for
the interest you&#8217;ve taken in me, that I appreciate
your generosity, that I take pleasure in your society?
Is that what I have no right to do, Mr. Buckland?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gerard would not be brow-beaten. He stuck
to his guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said stoutly, &#8220;that&#8217;s what I contend.
If you, knowing as you do that I&#8217;m madly in love
with you, that I&#8217;ve loved you through everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
in the face of mysteries and secrets which were enough
to make me decide never to speak to you again, in
the face of&mdash;other things of which I scarcely dare
speak&mdash;if you, knowing all this, as I say, have sent
for me only to tell me you&#8217;re grateful for my interest
and all the rest of it, you&#8217;re treating me badly. You
have no right to try to make me think of you more
than I do, no right even to be kind, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and she answered steadily&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless I&#8217;m prepared to give up my career, my
position, my friends, even, all for you? Is that what
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this with raised eyebrows, as if expecting
him to receive her speech with a denial; but he took
up the challenge at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that, I suppose, is what I do
mean. I don&#8217;t think you ought to encourage a man
to the extent you are encouraging that young Van
Santen, and to try to encourage me&mdash;at the same
time. It doesn&#8217;t matter when a girl plays that sort
of game with men who don&#8217;t really care for her.
But this Yankee fellow appears to be in earnest, and
by Jove! you can&#8217;t pretend to know that I&#8217;m not.
You ought to make up your mind, and throw over
the one, and stick to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you appreciate the difficulty of my
position, Mr. Buckland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose I do. How can I? You don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
take me into your confidence. And I&#8217;m ready to do
without that. All I ask is that you should decide
for your own happiness. If you think you will be
happier with Van Santen for a husband than with
me, why marry him and be happy; but I don&#8217;t believe,
somehow, that you do think that. I don&#8217;t think
you would send for me if you had nothing but that
to tell me. Come, Rachel, why did you send for me?
What had you to tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison&#8217;s handsome face quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost wish,&#8221; she said, &#8220;now, that I hadn&#8217;t
sent for you; but&mdash;&#8221; Suddenly her face changed,
and he saw a look of intense pain pass over it. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t bear that&mdash;you should think&mdash;I didn&#8217;t
care. And&mdash;only I don&#8217;t want you to ask me why&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t dare to offend Denver by letting him think
I cared for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, you need not have turned away from me
as you did, without a word. You might have given
me a word, a smile, a look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel&#8217;s breath came quickly, her face softened,
her eyes grew tender, and she whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dare!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were an admission, and in a moment
Gerard was close beside her, looking into her face,
begging her not to play with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me, Rachel, you love me, and not this
fellow! Why don&#8217;t you own it? Why can&#8217;t you
throw him over, and tell him and everyone that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
care for me, that you&#8217;re going to marry me? Don&#8217;t
worry your head about your career, about money,
about anything. I can&#8217;t make you rich at once, but
I&#8217;m not quite a pauper even now. You will have to
make some sacrifices, but they won&#8217;t be so hard.
Your mother will not mind living in a smaller house,
and your sister has had a year&#8217;s schooling, and Lady
Jennings will take charge of her, and bring her out
and all that. Even for your family there&#8217;s no need
for you to sacrifice your own happiness any longer.
Rachel, Rachel, say that you will cut yourself off
from all these people whom you hate and whom you
are afraid of, and make up your mind to be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was deeply moved by his passionate words, and
her tears were falling fast. But she was steadfast,
even in her sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t ask me why,
but I can&#8217;t. I know I&#8217;ve been selfish to ask you to
come to speak to me, but I couldn&#8217;t let you go like
that&mdash;thinking I was like a stone. I&#8217;m involved&mdash;too
deeply to get free. There&mdash;that&#8217;s all I dare tell
you. And now you had better try to forget me; it&#8217;s
the only thing to do. I&#8217;ve thought it over, indeed,
and I can&#8217;t get free, and I can&#8217;t move independently.&#8221;</p>

<p>This admission passionately uttered, was a terrible
shock to Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will the end be&mdash;it must have an
end?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>She turned upon him a look of intense alarm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;An end! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke out boldly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose it can go on forever? That
the mystery will never be found out? That you can
go on forever escaping by the skin of your teeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint smile, confident if not very happy, appeared
on her features.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in clever hands, very clever hands,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the work revolts you! It&#8217;s horrible&mdash;shocking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t discuss that now. I&#8217;ve told you
before all that I could tell you about it. There&#8217;s
Arthur coming for me. I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment. Tell me honestly: would you give
everything up and marry me, if you could?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I dare answer you truly;
but I will&mdash;if you will promise to take no advantage
of what I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, yes, I would throw over everything&mdash;if
I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>He touched her arm trembling and hoarse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now promise me just this, that you will make one
appeal&mdash;one strong appeal&mdash;this week, at once,
and try to get free; and let me know if you succeed.
You will, if your heart is set on it, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head drearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You overrate my determination, my strength of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
will, all the fine and noble qualities which, somehow or
other, you still contrive to imagine in me,&#8221; said she
gently. &#8220;I have no such force of character as you
think. I&#8217;m a poor, wretched puppet, dancing to anyone
who is clever enough to play the right tune.
Don&#8217;t hope, don&#8217;t hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope, all the same,&#8221; cried he passionately,
and hurriedly, as Arthur, perceiving that he was
coming too soon, delayed a little, and lingered just
out of earshot. &#8220;I want you to make this appeal,
and to let me know the result. Will you? Will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you the result already,&#8221; said she despondently;
&#8220;but if you like, I will make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had no time to say more, for Arthur had
joined them, rather sheepishly, rather bewildered.
He carried Miss Davison back to her friends, and then
caught Gerard up as he was leaving the grounds,
having made him a sign that he wanted a word with
him.</p>

<p>As soon as the two young men met, Arthur
spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel is treating you badly,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s encouraging you, I could see by her
looks, and yours. But&mdash;she&#8217;s engaged to Denver
Van Santen all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was startled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Denver says so&mdash;so do the family. It&#8217;s looked
upon as settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard laughed harshly; but he would not believe.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may think so, but they may make too sure,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Arthur Aldington threw at him a compassionate
look, as one does at a man, once intelligent and
amiable, who has just been declared a lunatic. But
the words which rose to his lips, words of congratulation
to Gerard on his escape, he thought it wiser not
to utter.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of a week Gerard received a letter addressed
in a hand-writing which he did not know, but
which he felt sure was that of Rachel Davison. The
very envelope and note paper seemed, he thought, to
be characteristic of her.</p>

<p>The letter itself was very short.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Buckland</span>,&mdash;I have kept my word
to you. I have tried, and I have failed, as I said I
should. Burn this, please.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rachel.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Gerard looked long at the words, which seemed to
burn into his brain. He knew what misery of effort
and failure they recorded. But he did not comply
with her command and burn the letter. He folded it
carefully again, and treasured it as he might have
done a communication from a dear friend. It seemed
to him to be the knell of all his hopes.</p>

<p>But in spite of the despair with which the letter
and his knowledge of some of the facts of Rachel&#8217;s
position inspired him, he did not cease to think about
her, and to wonder if there were no possible means
of freeing her from the unseen hands which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
holding her prisoner. If he had believed Denver to
be an honorable man, he would have stifled his own
feelings, and would have found consolation in knowing
that, by marrying him, she would free herself at
once from the thraldom in which she was held.</p>

<p>But unhappily, he could not feel sure that Denver
himself was honest, and his memories of the day spent
at the Priory were by no means of a sort to leave
upon his mind an impression of unmixed innocence
and bliss.</p>

<p>Was Denver one of the guiding spirits of a conspiracy,
of which the man with the white mustache
was a member? And was Denver anxious to marry
Rachel in order to make stronger the bonds in which
she was held?</p>

<p>Against this notion there stood out the remembrance
of the rest of the Van Santen family; his
knowledge that the father was a man of wealth and
good repute; the mother a good creature incapable
of guile; the daughters charming women, of whom
it was difficult to suspect anything wrong; the two
brothers indeed were not so satisfactory, but there
was this to be said of Denver, that he boasted openly
of his skill at cards, and was ready to challenge all
comers. Of the plain-featured Harry, with the hard,
sunless smile, Gerard knew nothing. Whether he
won or lost at cards he did not talk about his luck,
and his manner was as quiet and reticent as that of
his brother was swaggering and loud.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Somehow Gerard did not trust him the more on
that account.</p>

<p>While Gerard was still smarting from the blow
of Rachel&#8217;s letter, he was much surprised on reaching
home to his chambers one afternoon at about five
o&#8217;clock, to hear that a lady had called to see him, and
not finding him, had said that she would call again
between five and six.</p>

<p>While he was still asking questions about this mysterious
lady, with certain absurd but undefined hopes
in his heart, he was informed that she had come back
again, and there was ushered into his presence, to
his intense astonishment, the homely figure of Mrs.
Van Santen.</p>

<p>He was so much surprised that for the moment he
could scarcely greet her. He at once guessed that
she had something to tell which he should not care
to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t expect to see me, did you, Mr. Buckland?
I guess you are about as surprised as if the
Empress of Morocco had looked in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect this pleasure, certainly. It is
all the greater,&#8221; stammered Gerard, as he offered her
a chair, and ordered some tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t you trouble to get me any tea.
I&#8217;ve had some,&#8221; said the good lady, as she settled herself
in his best arm-chair, and looked round the room.
&#8220;And so these are bachelor chambers, are they? And
do you do your own house-keeping, Mr. Buckland?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>&#8220;Some of it,&#8221; said Gerard, smiling. &#8220;Not always
very successfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder you don&#8217;t suit yourself with a wife, Mr.
Buckland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had thoughts of it sometimes. But on the
whole&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell me,&#8221; and she suddenly turned upon him
a pair of eyes which he saw to be full of unexpected
shrewdness, &#8220;that you had thoughts of Miss Davison.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grew pale at the remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately she had no thoughts of me,&#8221; he
said hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Mrs. Van Santen bent forward, and
stared intently into his face. &#8220;There was something
in it then? You know her well, this Miss Davison,
Mr. Buckland?&#8221;</p>

<p>What on earth was she going to ask him? Gerard,
feeling that he should be called upon to go through
a trying ordeal, braced himself up to the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting her at the house
of several of my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know her people too, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know her mother, her sister, and, as I&#8217;ve
said, a good many friends of hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! And they&#8217;re good sort of people, satisfactory
sort of people? There, there, don&#8217;t get so
red. I don&#8217;t mean to put you through a long catechism.
But the fact is, one of my sons has gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
and fallen in love with the girl, and I&#8217;m not quite sure
I approve of it. I&#8217;m particular about my sons. I
want them to marry girls who will have a good influence
over them, and I&#8217;m not quite sure about this
young woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was aghast. He could see that the mother&#8217;s
shrewdness had fathomed the fact that there was some
mystery about Miss Davison, and, with the daring of
an American, she had at once searched in the ranks
of her acquaintances for someone who would be likely
to tell her all she wanted to know about her proposed
daughter-in-law. She had had the wit to guess that
Gerard, who was evidently in love with the girl himself,
would not be inclined to be too indulgent towards
her, or to paint her family or herself in too
rosy colors to his successful rival&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>Gerard did not know what to say. He felt quite
sure that, whatever might be the ugly truth about
the bondage Rachel was in, she was quite good enough
for a man like Denver, a boastful, swaggering fellow,
fond of cards and of little else, and as obtrusive and
bold in his love-making as if he had been twenty
times Rachel&#8217;s superior.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he shrank from telling a direct
lie to this simple and trusting woman, who had come
to him in her doubts and fears to learn the truth about
her son&#8217;s future wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; he said rather coldly, &#8220;your son is old
enough and clever enough to hold his own, and to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
ready to influence his wife rather than to be influenced
by her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;One might say so, if one knew the world less well
than I do,&#8221; she said shortly. &#8220;But a handsome
wife can do a lot one way or the other with a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think Miss Davison&#8217;s influence
would be other than good?&#8221; asked Gerard.</p>

<p>The old lady put her head on one side and looked
at him keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s a kind of instinct, as one may say,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;Or perhaps it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve noticed
and wondered at. She&#8217;s by way of being a bit of a
flirt, isn&#8217;t she now, Mr. Buckland? She&#8217;s been nice
to you, and nice to Denver, of course. And it seems
to me she&#8217;s looked at that young man Jones in a way
that suggested that she&#8217;d been nice to him too,
though, mind you, she told us she&#8217;d never met him
before he came to our house. Now do you happen to
know whether that was true or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady had been sharp-eyed, and Gerard felt
uneasy under her keen glance.</p>

<p>He thought evasion of the point his best course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Jones?&#8221; he asked innocently. &#8220;Have
I met him? Do I know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was at the Priory that day you came,&#8221; said
Mrs. Van Santen. &#8220;A quiet-looking young man
with a black mustache.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Gerard had some reason for believing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the young Van Santens knew Cecil Jones as well as
Rachel did, but he could not make this suggestion
to their innocent old mother. So he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember; but I can tell you nothing about
him, as it was the first time I&#8217;d met him myself, and
I haven&#8217;t seen him since.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady was watching him keenly. Evidently
she was conscious that something was not quite
above-board in her surroundings; but Gerard, while
sympathizing with her strongly, felt that he could
not betray his own fears, lest he should bring suspicion
upon Miss Davison.</p>

<p>He thought that the motherly body had perhaps
been slowly waking to the knowledge that her sons&#8217;
card-playing was excessive, and that she might also
have heard nasty things said about Denver&#8217;s unfailing
luck. She seemed rather disappointed that
she could not learn more from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now as to this Miss Davison,&#8221; she went on, in a
grumbling tone, &#8220;of course she&#8217;s very good-looking
and all that, and dresses in style, and carries herself
like a queen; but I should like to meet her mother,
and the girl doesn&#8217;t seem to want to let us meet. Do
you know all about the old lady? And her family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the mother is the widow of an officer who
had rather a distinguished career, and that the family
is a good one, several members of it holding high
posts in the army and navy, especially the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady nodded dubiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>&#8220;I should like to see some of these grand relations,&#8221;
she said at last, rather sharply. &#8220;We&#8217;re good
enough for ladies with titles to call upon; I should
have thought we were good enough for these Davisons!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no suspicion of that sort of thing
about them,&#8221; said Gerard hastily. &#8220;Mrs. Davison
is the mildest and gentlest of elderly ladies, and she
would be very shy, I think, if she were to find herself
in such a merry crowd as that you had at the Priory
the Sunday I was there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t she live with her daughter?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Van Santen aggressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Davison has to live in London, on account
of her work. It doesn&#8217;t agree with her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! That place agrees with most mothers that
agrees with their young daughters,&#8221; said she dryly.
&#8220;And as for Miss Davison&#8217;s work, she&#8217;s having a
good long holiday, I guess, just now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t she come backwards and forwards to
town from the Priory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she does, now and then; but she must
be clever if she can do much work during the short
time she&#8217;s away! However, I won&#8217;t take up your
time, Mr. Buckland, if you&#8217;re busy. I&#8217;m sorry you
can&#8217;t say more to set my mind at rest about the girl.
But, anyhow, I hope you&#8217;ll come down and see us
again. We&#8217;re always glad to see our friends, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
know, and there&#8217;s generally a good many of them
down there, and we give them a good time, as you
know. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook hands with him and went away, refusing
to let him accompany her as far as the door,
where she said that she had a cab waiting.</p>

<p>Her visit made Gerard uneasy, as it confirmed some
of his fears. He felt little doubt that the mother was
anxious about her sons&#8217; gambling propensities, and
that her sharp eyes had discovered that there was
some mystery about the woman whom she, at least,
looked upon as her younger son&#8217;s fianc&eacute;e.</p>

<p>The visit of the old lady left him in a state of
great confusion of mind. He did not know quite
how things stood at the Priory, whether the engagement
was definite, in spite of Rachel&#8217;s promise, or
whether she was waiting, as she had said she would
do, for Mr. Van Santen&#8217;s appearance.</p>

<p>And he could not tell how much Mrs. Van Santen
really knew about Miss Davison, and whether she was
concealing the full extent of her suspicions, in order
to learn more if she could.</p>

<p>He wished that he could get another opportunity
of conversing with Rachel herself; and he resolved, in
spite of his knowledge that he would find the experience
a trying one, upon going down to the Priory
again, as Mrs. Van Santen had invited him to do, on
the very next Sunday.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>The weather had changed since his last visit; the
evenings had become chilly; and the card-playing
was carried on with more zest than ever in consequence.</p>

<p>Otherwise the essential features of the hospitality
offered were the same. Cora sang; Delia went from
group to group, with ready tact and charm smoothing
over gaps in the conversation, and introducing
to each other such people as she thought would
find each other&#8217;s conversation congenial. Mrs. Van
Santen was the same homely, dear old soul as ever,
pouring out tea and coffee with energy, and plaintively
telling her sons she wished they had something
better to do than play cards morning, noon, and
night. While the brothers played poker and bridge
assiduously, and Rachel, as handsomely dressed as
ever, but with a face paler than before, took rather
a background position, and seemed listless and languid,
and anxious to avoid Gerard.</p>

<p>Arthur Aldington was there, but Cecil Jones was
not. And the time passed much as it had passed on
the occasion of Gerard&#8217;s last visit until quite late in
the evening, when suddenly, while Gerard was sitting
in the music-room, with Arthur, listening to Cora&#8217;s
exquisite singing, a man&#8217;s voice rang out through the
adjoining room, and that in which they were, from
the room devoted to card-playing, which was the
furthest away of all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;I say that you&#8217;re not playing fair! I say that
I&#8217;ve been cheated!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the voice of Sir William Gurdon, and upon
the last word they all heard his fist come down with a
loud crash upon the table.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> Gerard the sounds of the disturbance came with
a curious sense of something long expected having
come to pass. He scarcely felt so much as a slight
shock of surprise.</p>

<p>Being, therefore, in a condition to notice things,
he looked round him at the various faces in the music-room,
and noted the effect the noise had upon his
companions.</p>

<p>Cora, who was singing at the piano to her own accompaniment,
stopped short with a low cry, and covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Arthur who was standing beside her, grew red and
indignant, and called Sir William by several uncomplimentary
names.</p>

<p>Lady Sylvia and Delia, who were talking on a sofa,
looked at each other in horror, and rose, as if uncertain
what to do.</p>

<p>Two men whom Gerard had previously seen at the
Priory, and who were staying in the music-room to
listen to Cora&#8217;s singing in the intervals of poker, muttered
something to each other in an undertone, and
promptly went to the scene of the disturbance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Gerard, having noticed these things, and hearing
that the disturbance in the card-room was growing
louder instead of calming down, slipped out of the
room and across the next, and looked in at the third,
where the unpleasant scene was taking place.</p>

<p>As he passed through the intermediate room, he
noticed that Mrs. Van Santen, with her poor old face
blanched with horror, was sitting alone bolt upright
in a corner, clasping her hands and apparently too
much alarmed to speak or to move.</p>

<p>In the card-room itself all was confusion. Sir
William Gurdon, flushed, excited, scarcely intelligible
was glaring across the card-table at Denver Van Santen,
who had risen, like all the rest of the players, and
who was standing with his arms folded and with a
proud look of indignation on his handsome face, surrounded
by men who were all speaking at once, some
addressing one of the disputants, and some the other,
and all failing in making themselves distinctly heard.</p>

<p>Harry Van Santen, who was the coolest man in the
room, was the first person to make himself clearly
heard. Standing on the outskirts of the crowd, he
cried, in a thin, sharp, penetrating voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him a chance. Make yourself understood,
Sir William, if you&#8217;re sober enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words, which raised a fresh issue, and were
met with a torrent of incoherent words from the
young baronet, and with murmurs from the rest of
the men, the ladies in the room, who had most of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
drawn away from the crowd of angry men, and
gathered in a knot in a corner, whispered to each
other and made towards the door.</p>

<p>Harry Van Santen, who perceived this movement,
hastened to open the door, saying in a low voice to the
most important lady of the group&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. This is no scene for you
ladies. The fellow&#8217;s drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shut the door when they had all gone out, and
returned to the card-table, where three or four of the
men were now with difficulty holding Sir William
back from a personal assault upon Denver whose
calmly contemptuous attitude and tone were irritating
him to madness.</p>

<p>The uproar continued, and indeed grew worse, as
excited partisans on either side tried to outshout the
rest.</p>

<p>In the midst of the noise and the turbulent movements
of the crowd of men a figure flitted lightly past
Gerard, followed immediately by another; and Delia
and Miss Davison, the former leading, the other following
close behind, made their way into the group
with the authority born of combined intelligence and
experience, and at once found a hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Delia, &#8220;this scene is very distressing,
and not one of you can make himself heard
or understood if you all speak at once. Will you
separate for a time, and all think calmly over what
has happened&mdash;or has not happened&mdash;and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
come together to discuss the matter like reasonable
persons? If not for your own sakes, I think you will
do so for my mother&#8217;s and for ours, will you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Manner, voice, tone, all were perfect, and one after
another the men fell back, acknowledging the justice
of her speech, and willing to obey her suggestion.</p>

<p>Sir William alone of the visitors was obdurate.
While Denver merely retreated a few steps, and then
threw himself with an air of insolent defiance on a
sofa, the baronet maintained his position in the middle
of the room, and poured forth his woes as incoherently
and volubly as ever.</p>

<p>He paid no heed to Delia, who looked at Miss Davison
with a little gesture of despair.</p>

<p>Then Rachel came up to Sir William, and laying
her hand on his sleeve, said gently&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, Sir William, you had better talk
this over quietly with someone&mdash;with me, if you like?
And I will listen to all you have to say, and will do
anything I can to put the matter right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t put it right. I beg your pardon, Miss
Davison, but really this isn&#8217;t a thing I can discuss
with a lady. I&#8217;ve been che&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hush, hush! Think what you&#8217;re saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been cheated, I say. I&#8217;m sorry to have had
to make a disturbance, but it doesn&#8217;t alter the fact
that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the sake of the ladies of the family, won&#8217;t
you be reasonable? Wait a little; calm down a little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
and then hear what there is to be said on the other
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to be said, Miss Davison, nothing,
that is to say, that I could listen to or believe.
You must really excuse me. It&#8217;s with the men of the
family that I have to deal. Or at least with the fellow
Denver. But I suppose it&#8217;s six of one and half
a dozen of the other, and that while one cheats at
poker, the other does at bridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the influence of the lady&#8217;s gentle talk, Sir
William had grown, not only too coherent, but so
definite and precise in his accusations, so sweeping in
his charges, that every ear was strained to catch what
he said, and Denver, lounging on the sofa, grew perceptibly
redder as he was forced to listen too.</p>

<p>But Miss Davison, determined to end this painful
scene in her own way, took the young baronet&#8217;s arm,
almost as if she had been taking him into custody,
and insisted on his leading her&mdash;or more properly
being led by her&mdash;into the adjoining room, where
Mrs. Van Santen, still the picture of woe, was sitting
in her high-backed chair, and receiving the condolences
of one or two of the ladies, while the others
went into the music-room, with the exception of Lady
Sylvia, who, much disgusted at the scene she had been
forced to witness, had ordered her car round and
taken her departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say something nice to the old lady, do, Sir William,&#8221;
pleaded Rachel coaxingly in his ear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;How can I say anything nice to her, when I know
her son is a card&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison would not let him finish.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know nothing certainly,&#8221; she broke in
quickly. &#8220;You suspect, but that&#8217;s not enough. Do
pray remember what you owe to all of us, and whatever
you may think or fancy, keep your suspicions
to yourself until you can talk things over quietly
with another man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m certain&mdash;&#8221; began he again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell what you think to&mdash;to&mdash;let me
see&mdash;Mr. Buckland and Mr. Aldington. They saw
everything. Let them judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, they saw nothing,&#8221; persisted Sir William,
who was now speaking more quietly, but who
was not in the least disposed to waver in his statement
as to what he had seen. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they were
even in the room till the row had begun.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was leading him gently across the middle room,
deeming it more prudent not to let him speak to Mrs.
Van Santen in his obvious state of irritation. She
made him take her, therefore, into the music-room,
where Cora and Arthur were conversing near the
piano, and where two or three other small knots of
people were discussing the distressing affair in low
voices.</p>

<p>Gerard was sitting by himself not far from the
piano, and Delia had come in to do her usual work
of smoothing things over in any direction where she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
saw that her services would be useful. Miss Davison
made straight for Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do, Mr. Buckland,&#8221; said she, bending down to
speak pleadingly, and meanwhile looking at him with
steady eyes eloquent of her anxiety, &#8220;speak to Sir
William, and try to persuade him to make some sort
of apology, to believe that he has made a mistake, a
great and dreadful mistake. I don&#8217;t want him to
leave the house until he&#8217;s been brought to listen to
reason,&#8221; she added earnestly, speaking quickly, and
in such a low voice that only Gerard heard her.</p>

<p>For he had started to his feet at her first words,
and was standing on one side of her, while Sir William,
still angry and stiff, was on the other.</p>

<p>Gerard felt himself to be in a very difficult position.
Of course he believed implicitly that the baronet
was right, that he had suddenly found out the
meaning of the constant and heavy losses at cards
which he had sustained when playing with the young
Van Santens. It was horrible to find Rachel taking
the part of these men, whom he now looked upon as
little better than swindlers, knowing, as he did, that
she must be perfectly well aware of what had been going
on.</p>

<p>And yet he did not like to refuse her request, especially
as, even if his suspicions and those of Sir William
were correct, the baronet had now had his lesson,
and it was most desirable on all accounts to avoid a
scandal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>So, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation, he said, &#8220;All right.
I&#8217;ll do what I can,&#8221; and thrusting his hand through
the young baronet&#8217;s arm, he led him into the conservatory
which opened from this room, and asked
him to tell him all about it.</p>

<p>Briefly and clearly&mdash;for he had now had time to
collect his thoughts&mdash;Sir William explained exactly
what he had seen, and his reasons for believing that
he had been robbed.</p>

<p>Gerard listened attentively and without interruption,
and was quite sure that the young baronet was
correct in his surmise, and that Denver, having
robbed him persistently and with ease, had at last
grown careless, and manipulating the cards without
so much skill as usual, had been found out.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Sir William, when he had finished
his recital, &#8220;that&#8217;s what I saw; and whatever you
tell me, I shall think the same, that I&#8217;ve been cheated,
and that to-night is probably not the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard did not at once reply. Cora and Arthur
Aldington were observing them, and he saw the girl
whisper something to Arthur, in response to which he
nodded, and leaving her, strolled over to join the two
young men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ve changed your mind about what
you fancied you saw,&#8221; said he to Sir William, who
laughed dryly and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These Yankees
have had me for a mug; and I&#8217;ve no doubt, as I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
just been saying to Buckland, that what I found
out to-night was really only the end of what had
been going on for some time, in fact ever since I was
fool enough to come here first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur looked angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Gurdon, I think you ought to measure
your words a little more carefully,&#8221; he said stiffly.
&#8220;We are friends of these people, Buckland and I,
and we can&#8217;t allow such things to be said uncontradicted,
can we?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Sir William, it&#8217;s impossible for you to
be quite sure on such a point. It would need some
confirmation&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confirmation! Do you doubt my word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. What I do doubt is whether we
ought to be sure without proof stronger than the eyes
of one person. No, no, don&#8217;t get angry again. I
mean that, supposing I had seen what you saw, and
believed what you believed, I should have thought
twice about bringing such a grave&mdash;such an awful
accusation&mdash;in a room full of ladies&mdash;and should
have waited to discuss quietly with some other fellows
what was the best thing to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir William reddened. He himself had by this
time begun to feel considerable regret that he had
been so rashly outspoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; he grumbled, &#8220;to give advice
like that; but I tell you, when you suddenly make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
discovery like that&mdash;when you&#8217;re absolutely sure,
mind you, as I was and am&mdash;you forget all rules of
prudence, even perhaps of propriety, and you go for
the swindler there and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh&mdash;sh,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>Arthur reddened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, I say, Gurdon, you shouldn&#8217;t say things
like that without a lot more proof than you&#8217;ve got,
that things are not on the square,&#8221; said he, with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! What better proof can a man have
than the evidence of his own eyes?&#8221; asked Sir William.
&#8220;I&#8217;m convinced, as I tell you, that I&#8217;ve been
deliberately robbed. And the only reason why I&#8217;m
allowing myself to be persuaded to sit here quietly
and to let things simmer down, instead of leaving the
house at once, is that the thing is too flagrant to be
passed over, and that I intend to give information
about it to the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both his hearers protested at once, incoherently, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Arthur. &#8220;How on earth can
you bring disgrace upon the ladies by doing such a
thing as that? How can you, after being hospitably
received by Mrs. Van Santen, give information
against one of her sons? It&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do it, though,&#8221; said Sir William,
with ominous tranquillity. &#8220;If I were not absolutely
certain of what I saw, I need not tell you I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
never do such a thing. As it is, I&#8217;m convinced I
was only what you call hospitably received for the
purpose of being plundered; and, as I say, I&#8217;m not
going to put up with it quietly. I&#8217;m going to
give information to the police. If there&#8217;s nothing
in my charge, it will be all right, of course.
They will listen to me quietly, and no more will be
heard of it. But if, on the other hand, the information
I give chimes in with anything they know, or
may know in the future, about these people, then my
evidence may prove useful, and I shouldn&#8217;t hesitate
to give it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so quietly determined that Gerard looked
upon it as a hopeless task to try to dissuade him
from his purpose. Indeed, he was not sorry to hear
his intention. If the Van Santens were swindlers, it
was time they were brought to justice. And if, unhappily,
Miss Davison were mixed up with them,
there was ample time to warn her of what was in store
for the family.</p>

<p>Arthur, however, could not take it so quietly. He
was indignant at the aspersions cast upon the Americans,
and poured forth an eloquent tribute to their
charms, pointing out that he too had lost money
at cards there, but that he did not shriek out that he
had been robbed, but ascribed his losses to his own
chuckleheadedness in playing with people who openly
said that they played a better game than he did.</p>

<p>All such sneers as these, however, were lost upon Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
William. And to Arthur&#8217;s reminder that he would
be making things very unpleasant for the ladies who
were among the visitors at the Priory, the baronet
was equally deaf. Indeed, he took this suggestion
as the text for another sermon.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the by,&#8221; he said to Gerard, &#8220;have you ever
noticed that, although the Van Santens get plenty of
visitors, you never meet any of their own countrymen
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard himself had noticed the fact, and said so,
adding, however, that he believed it was usual with
Americans to invite English people of rank, whenever
they could get them, in preference to their own people.</p>

<p>Sir William, however, persisted in seeing a sinister
significance in everything that concerned the Van
Santens, and he turned to communicate his doubts
to another man, while Arthur, full of indignation,
went back to Cora, and bursting with anger, most
indiscreetly let out the fact that Sir William was
going to complain about his supposed grievance to
the police.</p>

<p>Cora turned very pale, and uttered a little scream
of horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you may tell Sir William from me that he&#8217;s
not a gentleman,&#8221; she said, with flashing eyes.
&#8220;Whatever he may think of himself and his title, he&#8217;s
just the meanest thing that breathes! When he&#8217;s
been received here so well, and has had such a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
time! Oh, what will my mother say? I must go and
tell her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t, if I were you, at least till the people
are gone,&#8221; said Arthur persuasively. &#8220;Remember,
he can&#8217;t do you any harm. He can give as much information
as he likes; no notice will be taken of it,
and he will merely be informed that observation shall
be kept upon the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the words inflamed Cora&#8217;s wrath still more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Observation kept upon our house!&#8221; she said indignantly.
&#8220;Where people of rank come every day!
No, indeed, the police shall do nothing of the sort.
Let the fellow dare to bring an honest, open charge
against my brothers, and then see what evidence we
shall bring on our side! Observation indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she left him, and ran, shaking with indignation,
into the next room, where she took Mrs. Van
Santen aside, and poured into her ears the story of
Sir William&#8217;s cowardly attacks and threats.</p>

<p>The old lady, in great alarm, called for Delia and
Miss Davison, and hurriedly consulted them as to
what was to be done. She was in a state of the greatest
anxiety, but showed more quiet good sense than
might have been expected from one so simple in the
world&#8217;s ways.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t one of you two girls clever enough,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;to talk to this young man and show him that
he&#8217;s behaving as badly as a man can? What have
we done that he should insult us like this? Even if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Denver had not played fair&mdash;which we all know is
ridiculous&mdash;it would be worse behavior in this young
man to insult us all as he wants to do, than it
would have been of Denver to do what he says he believed
he saw him do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be stopped,&#8221; said Delia firmly. &#8220;He
must be made to see he&#8217;s making an ass of himself.
We can&#8217;t have a scandal made about us, and all our
English friends offended and made to stay away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was addressing Rachel, whose face was very
grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Miss Davison, &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t much
matter if he does behave as he suggests. Everybody
knows you and knows the sort of society you receive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that you, who have lots of friends in the best
society, actually stay with us,&#8221; added Delia.</p>

<p>Miss Davison assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think you need distress yourself
about this silly lad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He would harm no
one but himself if he were to go to a police-station
and tell his absurd tale. He has already made half
the people here think him mad, and I&#8217;m going to tell
him so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She swept across the floor and entered the music-room,
where the baronet was talking in a low voice,
but with great excitement, to two or three other
men who had been witnesses of the scene at the card-table.</p>

<p>She broke into the group and called him aside, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
in a voice which was audible all over the room, protested
strongly and energetically against his behavior.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought,&#8221; she said, with a haughty
movement of her handsome head, &#8220;that, if you had
been undeterred by any other consideration, the
knowledge that I, a friend of so many of your own
friends, have been staying with the Van Santens,
would have been enough to convince you that such
a thing as you imagine could not occur here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the young man, who had appeared so good-humored
and so easy to manage on previous occasions,
was now as firm and as stubborn as he had before
been gentle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is because you, a young lady of known position
and a friend of so many others of position, have
stayed with these people and made a friend of them,
that I and my friends have taken them up,&#8221; he retorted
shortly. &#8220;It makes them all the more dangerous
that they&#8217;ve succeeded in hoodwinking a lady
as clever as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word caused a movement of astonishment at
his tenacity, in the group of men who were within
hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Sir William, you talk as if you were in a
den of thieves!&#8221; said Miss Davison haughtily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Miss Davison, I am inclined to think that
I am,&#8221; retorted the baronet, as he bowed and withdrew
into the next room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Rachel was left standing, pale, indignant, frightened,
in the middle of the music-room. The other
men who had heard something of this short passage
of arms, came round her, apologizing for Sir William,
expressing the opinion that he had had too much
champagne, and that there was no other explanation
of his conduct than that, or a sudden attack of insanity.</p>

<p>Miss Davison received these remarks graciously,
again expressing her astonishment that Sir William
could make himself so ridiculous.</p>

<p>Before she had finished speaking, the group was
added to by two or three more persons, one of whom
was Gerard Buckland. With him she presently
walked away towards the conservatory, and when they
were out of hearing of the rest, she said in a low
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t succeed in persuading Sir William
not to carry out his absurd intention, but to declare&mdash;before
he leaves the house that he has given it up,
I advise you to look after him, Mr. Buckland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To look after him! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her eyelids slowly, and looked at him
with a strange, arresting steadiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I only mean, of course, that since it&#8217;s plain
that he is scarcely in his right senses, he ought to
be&mdash;<i>closely watched</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerard</span> stood still in a state approaching stupefaction
as Miss Davison, having given him this extraordinary
warning, turned quickly away.</p>

<p>He did not know whether she was speaking in the
interest of Sir William Gurdon or in that of the Van
Santens, but after a little reflection he decided that
he had better profit by her words, at least to the extent
of ascertaining exactly what the young baronet
was going to do, and how he fared in doing it.</p>

<p>Gerard had, on this occasion, come down by train
by himself, instead of in Arthur Aldington&#8217;s car.
Full of his resolution, and confirmed in it by Miss
Davison&#8217;s manner when he said good-bye, he went
down the drive by himself, and then waited outside the
gates for the coming of Sir William&#8217;s motor-car.</p>

<p>Sir William came out a few minutes later, driving
his car himself, as usual. Perceiving Gerard, he
stopped, and apparently anxious to have someone to
confide his grievances to once more, he asked him, as
Gerard had expected and hoped, whether he should
give him a lift back to town.</p>

<p>Gerard thanked him and took the seat beside Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
William, while the chauffeur got inside the car. As
Gerard expected, the baronet broke out into fresh
denunciation of the Van Santens without delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the one of them is any better than
the other, and I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to hear that
they&#8217;ve been warned out of New York. I&#8217;m going to
make some inquiries about them,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they know that?&#8221; asked Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay they do by this time. I&#8217;ve made no
secret of it since I found out I&#8217;d been cheated,&#8221; said
the baronet angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you keep your plans to yourself?
If you&#8217;re wrong, it&#8217;s rough upon them, but especially
upon the ladies of the family, whom you
surely don&#8217;t implicate in their brothers&#8217; malpractices&mdash;if
they are malpractices.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not wrong, I can&#8217;t be wrong. And as for
the ladies, I don&#8217;t accuse them of having anything
to do with their brothers&#8217; tricks, of course, but one
can&#8217;t consider those points when one is dealing with
rogues. And if you mean Miss Davison, I can only
say I&#8217;m surprised to find her in such dubious company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Gerard, unfortunately, had been too much
used to seeing Rachel in similar circumstances to be
deeply offended by the suggestion. But, doubtful
as he felt concerning the circumstances which had
made her such an intimate friend of the Americans,
he was bent on saving her from the punishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
which he knew that they deserved, and which he hoped
that she would contrive to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re right, you can&#8217;t be too cautious
in the way you go to work to bring them to book.
You had far better make inquiries yourself than at
once put the matter into other hands,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>The baronet shrugged his shoulders. Although
he passed for &#8220;a bit of a fool,&#8221; he was very tenacious
of his purpose when once he had made up his mind
upon any point, and he had thoroughly resolved upon
the course he meant to adopt now. So he said nothing
in answer to this, and before Gerard had decided
what to say next, they were both startled by an explosion,
followed by another, and the next moment
the tire of one of the back wheels of the motor-car
had burst, and the car itself was on its side in the
ditch by the side of the road.</p>

<p>Sir William was shot right over the wheel and into
the hedge on the other side of the ditch, while Gerard
was flung over the wind screen into the ditch itself.</p>

<p>A minute later he had scrambled out, unhurt but
plastered with mud, and was standing, with the
chauffeur by his side, looking at the wrecked car,
while Sir William, who had regained his feet and was
on the other side of the hedge in a stubble-field, was
expressing his indignation and annoyance, and, as
might have been expected, ascribing the accident to
the agency of the Van Santens.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no accident,&#8221; he said, as he stood, livid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
with rage, on the bank, when he had scrambled
through the hedge and had joined the other two.
&#8220;The back tires were perfectly sound when I left
town this afternoon. They&#8217;ve been tampered with
by those fellows at the Priory.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Gerard this fresh accusation seemed far-fetched
and absurd for the first moment; but when the
chauffeur joined his assurances to those of his master,
that the tires had been in perfect order, and moreover
that he had seen one of the gentlemen examining the
car, and when, upon inquiry, it turned out that the
gentleman in question was Denver Van Santen, even
Gerard began to think there might have been some
foul play.</p>

<p>After a short discussion it was decided that the
chauffeur should remain with the car, and that the
two gentlemen should walk on to the nearest town,
which was some two miles away, and make arrangements
both for the digging out of the car and for
continuing their journey by rail.</p>

<p>As they walked along, for the most part in silence,
along the road, which was shaded by a row of trees
on one side, Gerard fancied he heard footsteps on the
other side of the hedge. In the state of nervous excitement
and suspicion into which he and his companion
had both been thrown by the occurrences of
the evening, this incident seemed strange to Gerard,
who imparted his belief that they were being
shadowed to Sir William. Keeping his voice low he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
suggested that they should make a dash for the hedge
together at the point where he thought he had heard
the footsteps last.</p>

<p>The other agreeing, the two young men made a
rush for the hedge, climbed up the bank with rapid
steps, and scrambled through the briars just in time
to see a figure disappearing into a plantation near at
hand. At the suggestion of the baronet, they went
in pursuit, and got so close to the quarry that a few
more strides would have brought them up to him, when
suddenly he made a plunge forward, and disappeared
from their sight among the trees of the little wood.</p>

<p>Sir William would have made another dash to secure
him, but Gerard held him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Did you see what
he had in his hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir William drew back with a low cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he whispered back, &#8220;but I saw who he
was!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men exchanged looks, and then, with one
accord, they dropped the pursuit and regained the
road as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Not until they were a long way from the plantation
did they stop and exchange their thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;He carried a revolver,&#8221; whispered Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Harry Van Santen,&#8221; said Sir William.</p>

<p>After that, both men walked on faster, and said little,
until they had reached a part of the road so open
that there was no further need of caution.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Gerard by this time fully appreciated the value of
Miss Davison&#8217;s warning. She had guessed that some
attempt would be made upon the revengeful baronet,
and had done her best for him by her quietly dropped
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Gerard, when they could talk more
freely, &#8220;you will understand the need of caution in
dealing with these people. If you had been alone&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir William nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been all up with me by this time,&#8221;
he added grimly. &#8220;Well, you were right, Buckland,
one can&#8217;t be too careful in dealing with these people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take my advice <i>now</i>,&#8221; said Gerard
earnestly, &#8220;and give up all idea of going to the police
openly? Write to the Van Santens, say you&#8217;ve
had a talk with me, and that you are convinced you
made a mistake, and that you are ready to apologize!
Tell them that we had an adventure to-night, that we
came across a poacher, and nearly got up with him,
that he took us for keepers and ran with all his
might.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baronet looked at him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they believe that?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if they don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;I
want them to think that you&#8217;ve been frightened into
holding your tongue. I want you to keep clear of
police-stations to-night, as we shall probably be
shadowed. And I suggest that you should communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
with the police, if you mean to do so, by letter
only. And give a warning that, if a policeman is sent
to see you, he must be in plain clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir William, now thoroughly alarmed, agreed to
all these suggestions without demur, and following
the directions given him, took care not to go near a
police-station that night.</p>

<p>Two days later, after having remained indoors all
the time, he wrote to Gerard to tell him to keep away
from the Priory, as he had communicated with the
police, and a detective was to be among the guests on
the following Sunday. He said that he had written
an apology to Mrs. Van Santen, and &#8220;made it all
right with them.&#8221; And he ended by a hope that
Gerard would find some means to induce Miss Davison
to break off her connection with these dubious
people, at least until the police had satisfied themselves
about them.</p>

<p>Now Gerard dared not write to Miss Davison, for
fear of his letter falling into other hands than hers.
All he could do, therefore, was to go down to the
Priory on the following Sunday, in the hope that he
might be able to warn her to get away in time to
prevent her being involved in the catastrophe which
was bound to come.</p>

<p>He was very nervous as he approached the Priory,
having come by train, as on the last occasion. He
wondered whether Harry Van Santen knew that he
had been recognized, and whether he would find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
marked changes to have taken place in the conduct of
the establishment since the sensational charges
brought against it on the previous Sunday.</p>

<p>Rather to his surprise, he found everything as
usual there. Not even the ladies, who had been the
most frequent among the guests, appeared to have
been frightened away. For on entering the drawing-room
where they were all assembled after luncheon,
he at once recognized two or three faces of ladies who
had been there the Sunday before.</p>

<p>If possible, the gayety, which was a feature of the
place, was greater than ever. The Van Santens all
greeted him exactly as if nothing had happened, with
the exception of Mrs. Van Santen, who said to him
triumphantly, when he shook hands with her&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Buckland, I&#8217;m very pleased to see you
again. Have you heard that your friend Sir William
Gurdon has written a long and most handsome
apology for the way he behaved last Sunday? I got
it on Tuesday last, and I at once sent a copy of it
to all the ladies and gentlemen who were here when
he made that ill-mannered outbreak. I couldn&#8217;t send
you one, because I didn&#8217;t know your address. But
I&#8217;ll show you the letter itself presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard congratulated her as well as he could, and
in the meantime his eyes roamed about in search of
two people: Miss Davison for one; the detective who
was to be among the guests this day, for the other.</p>

<p>Miss Davison he soon discovered. She was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
only person there who appeared to be in the least
changed since the previous Sunday. Pale she always
was, but now she was ghastly; while the dark rings
under her eyes told an eloquent tale of sleepless nights,
and a peculiar haggard look about the outline of
her face betrayed to his eyes, keen where she was concerned,
the fact that she had been rendered uneasy
and unhappy by the occurrences of the momentous
day.</p>

<p>He did not at once approach her: he was particularly
anxious not to seem in a great hurry to
speak to her alone, and besides, he felt very diffident
as to her reception of the news he had for her.</p>

<p>Would she take the warning quietly and disappear
in time to escape the general disaster? Or would she
betray him, and make use of the information he had
for her in the interests of the Van Santens?</p>

<p>Gerard could not make up his mind on this point;
and he was in a state of great distress as to whether
he was about to render her a great service or to render
one to the American swindlers whom he dreaded
to find were her accomplices.</p>

<p>But everything must be risked for her sake. In
the meantime he looked carefully about him, in the
hope of discovering among those of the guests whom
he did not know the detective who was to be there on
the information of Sir William.</p>

<p>The task was an easy one. There was only one
strange face there, that of a man with a heavy black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
mustache who was, Gerard thought, unmistakably a
police officer in disguise.</p>

<p>This fact ascertained, he lost no time in approaching
Miss Davison, and, after the first greetings, said
to her in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look shocked, I beg. I have to warn you
that there is a police detective here to-day. Don&#8217;t
ask me how I know; but you may depend upon its
being the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison bowed her head in grave silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure of it!&#8221; she said in a low voice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> for a few moments there was silence. The
words Miss Davison had uttered so hastily, in response
to his warning that there was a detective present,
Gerard could not but look upon as an admission.</p>

<p>If all had been right at the Priory, why should
she have expected to see there an agent of the police?</p>

<p>She seemed to see that her words were a mistake,
for presently she laughed without much merriment,
and said, looking at him with a steady gaze which
had in it something of what he felt to be unmerited
reproach&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so your friend Sir William thinks he had
better be on the safe side. That is what you call
hedging, isn&#8217;t it, in racing matters? He writes a
letter of humble apology for his rudeness to Mrs.
Van Santen, and at the same time takes care to expose
her&mdash;and us all, to the ignominy of having a
detective introduced to the house to watch us and to see
that we do not cheat at cards?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard met her gaze steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the circumstances, I don&#8217;t think he is to be
blamed, Miss Davison. I think, on the contrary, that
his conduct is more excusable than mine. For as,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
whether he was cheated or no, he undoubtedly believed
that he was, he may have thought himself at
liberty to use all possible means of getting proof of
the fact. I, on the other hand, while believing that
he was cheated, and that other people have been
cheated here, have warned you of the fact that the
house is sheltering a detective, although I am afraid
you may make use of my warning to put these thieves
on their guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison heard him with a set white face, but
without any interruption. They were standing together
in the veranda, for, late as the season was,
the afternoon was so fine that the French windows
were open, and the guests of the Van Santens were
strolling in and out, between the house and the
grounds.</p>

<p>After a short pause she laughed again in the same
hard, forced way as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think I am likely to put thieves on their
guard against the possibility of detection, you must
believe that I am a friend, not to say an accomplice,
of thieves myself?&#8221; she said quietly, at last.</p>

<p>Gerard shook his head, but hesitated what to reply.</p>

<p>At last he said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t deny that I believe your
friends are not always well chosen. I have had proof
of it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that, if you were wise, you
would leave to her fate a woman who had so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
questionable friends, and whom you could not depend
upon from one moment to another?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard took up her challenge with sudden fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do think I should be wiser if
I could do as you suggest; but, unluckily for me, I
can&#8217;t. For, good or ill, Rachel, I love you so much
that I can&#8217;t believe the evidence of my own eyes when
you are in question. So that I am behaving like an
imbecile, and persisting in refusing to believe anything
but good of you, even though I am forced to
believe very much that is not good of your friends
and acquaintances.&#8221;</p>

<p>As usual when he made a speech like this, owning
his steady interest in her, Miss Davison&#8217;s face broke
up into softness and gentleness, thus riveting his
chains, even while she would give him no hope that she
was innocent of the things of which he thus by implication
accused her.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought she was on the point of
bursting into tears. But she exercised strong self-control,
and carefully abstaining from again meeting
his eyes, knowing what sort of look she should meet
if she did, she turned her head languidly in the direction
of the interior of the house, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t expect me to do anything but
take their part, you know. Whatever may be
thought, or fancied, or suspected of them by other
people, I always stand by my own side, even assisting
them to the utmost of my power.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; whispered Gerard desperately, &#8220;that
you will warn the Van Santens that there is a detective
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon him sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I shall do nothing of the kind; there&#8217;s
no need. Your friend has behaved absurdly, and
what he has done doesn&#8217;t make the least difference.
How should we mind who sees us, since we have
nothing to hide?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would not associate yourself with
these Americans,&#8221; said Gerard irritably. &#8220;I know
very well that you have nothing to hide, but I believe
that the case is different with them. If you believe
in them really, honestly believe in them and
trust them to deal honorably, as you say you do, I
want you to give me an understanding, a promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you promise&mdash;swear&mdash;that you will not
tell the Van Santens what I have just told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She at once said, in a low voice, but firmly and
resolutely&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear that I will not tell anyone here what you
have just told me&mdash;about the presence of a detective.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was surprised at this readiness to give her
oath, and indeed his doubts made him shudder. Was
she perjuring herself? He had had so many doubts
of her before, that he ought not to have felt so
strongly about this fresh one. But yet he shuddered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
again at the thought that she could be committing a
crime, just as he had done before.</p>

<p>Anxious to avoid the thought that she had sworn
with no intention of keeping her oath, he asked himself
whether her telling them would be useless, and they
perhaps knew already the news he had imparted to her.
There was another short pause, and then Miss Davison
said to him quickly, as she put her hand on the
window, as if to go indoors&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one warning I ought to give you. As
I have told you, it doesn&#8217;t matter a bit who is present,
because there is nothing to find out, and the play
to-day will be just as it has always been. But if
you want to prevent an unpleasant scene, you had
better keep the warning you have given me to yourself,
and not tell Arthur Aldington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because if you do, he will tell Cora Van Santen,
and she will be indignant, and will certainly speak
her mind openly about it, and there will be an explosion
of wrath, and explanations, and inquiries,
and the party will be broken up, and perhaps the
detective himself found out, exposed, and thrown out
of the house, and a fresh scandal will be made, just
as we have got rid of the old one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard thought this very good advice, though he
was surprised that she should give it. He readily
agreed not to say anything to Arthur about the presence
of the detective, and went indoors with her just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
in time to see the arrival of a batch of visitors,
among whom he saw the man Cecil Jones, whom he
believed to be a decoy of the Van Santens.</p>

<p>This belief was strengthened when he found that
Jones was in a jubilant and boastful mood, and that
he was telling the other visitors that he had come prepared
to beat Denver Van Santen at poker, having
provided himself with money enough to bluff him to
any extent he liked.</p>

<p>It seemed to Gerard that no man would have talked
like this, doing his best to invite the attentions of the
spoiler, after the scene of the preceding Sunday,
which must certainly have been talked about by all
the habitues of the Priory, unless he was an absolute
fool. And in spite of his sheepish looks and gentle
manners, Gerard had reason to believe that Cecil
Jones was by no means so silly as he looked.</p>

<p>Miss Davison was not the woman to have foolish
friends; and that Cecil Jones was the friend he had
seen her with on more than one occasion previous to
his visits to the Priory he was quite sure.</p>

<p>Gerard decided, therefore, that Jones, in his character
of decoy to the rest of the pigeons whom the
Van Santens plucked, had been allotted this r&ocirc;le of
careless and wealthy spendthrift in order to prove
that, in spite of the scene of the preceding Sunday,
the confidence of the visitors in the integrity of the
Americans was as great as ever.</p>

<p>Gerard was annoyed at this scheme and he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
care to show Cecil Jones that he did not believe in
his bluff.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were not here last Sunday, I think?&#8221; he
said dryly; &#8220;but no doubt you heard what took place
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did hear about it, of course,&#8221; said Jones, raising
his voice, so that he could be heard by the rest
of the people in the music-room, where they were
standing; &#8220;but I shouldn&#8217;t think of taking the word
of a man like Sir William Gurdon against that of
people I know and like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, everyone knows what he is, a fellow who
is getting through his money as fast as he can, and
who is as careless with his tongue as he is with his
cash,&#8221; replied Jones. &#8220;I suppose you think,&#8221; he went
on rather aggressively, &#8220;that, after last Sunday,
nobody ought to play anything but bagatelle and
dominoes with the Van Santens. You look upon me
as a fool to risk my money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Gerard quietly; &#8220;because
I know you won&#8217;t risk much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Gerard took care to keep his voice as
low as that of Jones was loud, Cora and Arthur,
who were, as usual, at the piano together, were so
intently interested in the discussion that they contrived
to hear these words, and they exchanged looks.</p>

<p>Cora was flushed and angry. She rose from her
seat at the piano and said quickly&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;Why did you come here to-day, Mr. Buckland,
if you believed the infamous things Sir William Gurdon
said, things, by the way, that he has apologized
most humbly for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could have given a better proof
that I took the right side in the argument than by
appearing here to-day, Miss Cora,&#8221; retorted Gerard
diplomatically.</p>

<p>Even while he spoke to her, he had his eye on Cecil
Jones, who had at once profited by Gerard&#8217;s turning
away to follow Miss Davison into the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>Cora being perforce content with this neat reply,
Gerard managed to escape, and went into the middle
room, where Mrs. Van Santen was pouring out tea.
He thought what a strange contrast she made, in her
simple gown, her black mittens, and the old-fashioned
brooch and hair bracelets which she persisted in wearing,
with the elegantly gowned daughters whose
taste in dress excited the admiration of the men visitors,
and the envy of the women.</p>

<p>Her quiet, old-fashioned, almost abrupt manner,
too, was a relief after the artificiality of some of the
other visitors, and Gerard wondered how she had
managed so soon to get over the terrible shock of
the preceding Sunday. He would have thought,
knowing the simplicity of the old lady, that the bare
suggestion of anything unfair in connection with
her household would have been enough to make her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
shut up the house, and return in dudgeon to America
with her daughters.</p>

<p>But she seemed to be in the same mood of placid
good spirits as usual; and he supposed that her sons
had known how, by getting hold of her by her weak
side, to smooth over the trouble, and to persuade her
that the unpleasant affair was only a passing
cloud, such as would never darken their atmosphere
again.</p>

<p>Close beside her he found, among others, Cecil
Jones and Miss Davison. He could see that, although
they said little to each other, there was some
secret understanding between the two, and he was
maddened at the thought that she had already broken
her oath, and that she was using Jones as a go-between
to carry to the Van Santens her knowledge
that there would be a detective in the house that day
to watch their proceedings.</p>

<p>Gerard would fain have believed such an artful
evasion of her oath impossible to Miss Davison, but
in the face of all that he suspected this was scarcely
credible.</p>

<p>But even at that moment the thought which
troubled him the most was that Rachel cared for Cecil
Jones, that he was more than an accomplice, more
than a friend, that he was her confidant, and her
lover.</p>

<p>Nay, the thought darted into his mind with a most
poignant rush that perhaps he might be her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
and that, if not, he was probably already her fianc&eacute;.</p>

<p>On that point he thought that she might perhaps
be more candid than upon the other, if taxed, and
at the first opportunity he followed her into the corner
of the room where she had seated herself, in sight
of the nearest card-table in the end room, on the
one hand, and of the figure of Cora seated at the
piano, on the other.</p>

<p>There was a seat near her, and he stood with one
knee on it, as he bent down and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you answer me a question truly, honestly,
Rachel, a question about yourself&mdash;and&mdash;someone
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t promise,&#8221; said she, in a low voice, with,
as he thought, a quick, self-conscious glance towards
Cecil Jones.</p>

<p>From the adjoining room, where Denver and some
other men were playing cards, came a reminder, in
Denver&#8217;s voice, of the other man of whom he had been
jealous, but whose chances Gerard now rejected, as
he could not believe that Miss Davison could have
given her heart to a card-sharper, who was also something
worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know whether this Jones is engaged to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint smile passed over her face, one of those
flitting, quickly fading ripples of gentle merriment
which were characteristic of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how many more people are you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
going to marry me to, Mr. Buckland? There was
Denver Van Santen&mdash;and now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He interrupted her with rash eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denver Van Santen! No. Even if you could
care for a card-sharper, which I own might be possible,
you could not, I&#8217;m sure, care for a murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison, who was leaning back carelessly in
her chair, sat up, looking deadly pale. With a commanding
air, she made him sit down beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked, fixing him with
a gaze which seemed to penetrate to his very soul. It
was evident that, however she might try to hide the
fact, she was thrown by his words into a state of
keenest tension.</p>

<p>His jealousy grew as he watched the change in her.
Did she really care for this man, then, and was the
tie which bound her to Cecil Jones one of business
interests only?</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said he, lowering his voice, so that no
one else should hear a whisper of the momentous
words he had to utter, &#8220;that Denver Van Santen was
the cause of the accident to Sir William&#8217;s car last
week, and that he shadowed us with a revolver, with
what object, unless he meant to rid himself of a person
whom he looked upon as dangerous, I can&#8217;t
imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison tried to laugh, but that resource she
had used too often that afternoon and her voice
sounded hard and her mirth artificial.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>&#8220;How absurd!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Can anything be
more preposterous than to accuse a person on such
flimsy grounds? for of course you only suppose that
you saw Denver, and Sir William only supposes it
also.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw, however, in her eyes, as she uttered the
words, that she felt by no means so certain as she
pretended to be of the childlike innocence of the
young poker-player.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do more than suppose,&#8221; he said quietly; &#8220;we
are both quite sure of what we saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. Then her eyes stole
a stealthy glance at the card-playing party in the
next room. Gerard watched her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you why I don&#8217;t believe you can care
for Denver Van Santen. I want to know whether
you care for the other fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to him with a scoffing air.</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth can it matter to you for whom I
care, Mr. Buckland, when you look upon me as an
accomplice of card-sharpers?&#8221; she asked lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I do care,&#8221; he replied desperately,
&#8220;except that you are such an enigma that
every detail concerning you is of surpassing interest
to me. I don&#8217;t understand you. I believe it&#8217;s difficult
to understand any woman; but certainly I never
believed it until I met you. But it seems to me that
you unite in your own person all the puzzling attributes
of all the women who ever lived. The consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
is that I adore you at one moment, I hate
you the next. One day I believe that all my suspicions
of you are flimsy and groundless, and that I
only want the key to solve the mystery which will
show you to be all I want to believe you; the next day
I can see in you only a malignant enchantress, charming
men to their undoing, without heart and without
conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you to believe that last description to
be true, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t&mdash;I won&#8217;t. Rachel, when I spoke to
you before about my feeling for you, you promised
to ask to be set free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I did ask&mdash;as I wrote you&mdash;and was refused.
Don&#8217;t begin the old argument again. It is
of no use. You shouldn&#8217;t have come here to-day&mdash;you
shouldn&#8217;t have come here at all. It is all pain,
nothing but pain and distress that you give yourself
and me by coming. Mr. Buckland, be warned by
me. This is not the place where women&mdash;or men,
either&mdash;are seen at their best. I don&#8217;t mean that
there is any harm in what we do, but the atmosphere
is not good, not wholesome. Take my advice: say
good-bye to me now, and go back to town, and don&#8217;t
come here again. As I&#8217;ve told you, my way and
yours lie far apart; there is no advantage in pretending
not to know it. Now, will you be good, and
wish me good-bye, and find you have an appointment
in town that takes you back early?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>The lights had been turned up, and Gerard knew
that old Mrs. Van Santen, from her corner of the
room near the tea-table, was watching him and Miss
Davison. These two were sitting close by the curtains
of the wide window, partly hidden by one of
them, indeed, though not sufficiently for the old lady
not to be able to see that something very interesting
was the subject of their conversation.</p>

<p>Gerard felt her eyes upon him, even when he was
not looking at her; and presently, even while he was
so much occupied with Rachel, he saw the old lady
beckon Delia to her, and speak to her hurriedly, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>In the meantime he turned to Miss Davison and
answered her question after a short pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t distress you by arguing in the old way
again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t take your advice
about going back to town immediately, though I
know your counsel is good. I want to see it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see what out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison&#8217;s eyes were attracted too, by this
time, in the direction of the old lady and Delia.</p>

<p>Gerard hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, shall we say the sequel to last Sunday&#8217;s
scene?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Miss Davison remained quite silent for
some moments, with her eyes cast down, and her hands
lying immovable in her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she said at last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>He had no time to explain before Mrs. Van Santen,
rising from her chair, crossed the room, taking such
a course that she came quite close to the two young
people. Gerard therefore, did not speak until he had
watched the old lady go into the card-room, where
he saw her standing close to Denver, without being
able to hear whether she spoke to him.</p>

<p>In the meantime Delia came strolling across to the
window, and rearranged a curtain which had been
pulled away from its proper folds by a chair placed
near it.</p>

<p>It was out of the question, therefore, for Gerard
to give Miss Davison any explanation of his rather
momentous words while members of the Van Santen
family were flitting about so close to them. And before
Delia had moved away, Denver Van Santen, quitting
the card-table, came up, and unceremoniously
drawing a chair close to Miss Davison, leaned forward
and looked sentimentally into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;m not going to let that fellow have you
all to himself this evening, Miss Davison,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And, as Rachel received this speech with an encouraging
smile, instead of snubbing the fellow, as
he felt that she ought to do, Gerard had nothing to
do but to withdraw and leave the Yankee in full and
undisputed possession of the field.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> although it had seemed to Gerard, when he first
arrived at the Priory that afternoon, that all was as
usual there, he had long before this discovered that
this was by no means the case.</p>

<p>Everything did indeed look as it had looked on his
previous visits. The visitors were quite as numerous,
the conversation was quite as lively. The groups
moved about from room to room, listened to the music
at one end of the suite, played cards at the other, and
drank tea between the two, with just the same appearance
of having nothing on their minds but the
amusement of the moment.</p>

<p>The Van Santens, on their side, behaved exactly
as they had always behaved; the young men played
bridge and poker, with intervals of conversation and
laughter with those of their guests who did not care
for cards. Cora sang as sweetly as ever, was just as
charming when, instead of singing or playing, she
was listening to Arthur&#8217;s impassioned speeches, or
lisping out her little crisp sentences by way of her
share in the general conversation.</p>

<p>Delia, as usual, flitted from group to group, never
in the same place long, and always bringing with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
a sense of repose and ease, the result of the singularly
tactful and neat way she had of setting things right
when they were going wrong.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Santen, perhaps, showed traces of the
emotion which the unpleasant scene of the preceding
Sunday had caused her. She was sensible enough, dear
old soul, not to disturb the general harmony by any
open allusion to the trouble on that occasion, or by
any appearance of anxiety about the present. But
she did not look quite so peaceful, quite so serene, as
she had looked before, and Gerard was quite sure
that she was keeping a watchful eye on her card-playing
sons, lest any more disturbances should break the
peace of her family and her guests.</p>

<p>But underneath all this surface appearance of
calm and pleasure Gerard was now conscious that
there was a current of anxiety, a subdued unrest,
which infected the whole of the Van Santen family,
and had spread, perhaps without their being fully
aware of it, to their guests.</p>

<p>It was easily explained, of course, by the occurrences
of the preceding Sunday, by the inevitable self-consciousness
which they had produced in everybody;
so that the visitors felt impelled to be more sprightly
and more at ease than usual, and the family, on their
side, had to keep up an air of having absolutely forgotten
the ill-mannered attack made upon one of
them by the hasty and impetuous Sir William.</p>

<p>Thus the general atmosphere seemed to be electric,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
charged with a sort of vague danger, and conducive
to excitement and unrest.</p>

<p>When Gerard found himself ousted by Denver, he
retreated to the music-room, and there he found
Arthur and Cora, no longer at the piano, but conversing
with intense seriousness in a corner of the
room. He had scarcely entered, when Mrs. Van Santen
came in, noiselessly, but wearing a look of unusual
excitement in her good old face. She went straight
to Cora, said a few words to her in an undertone,
and went back again into the next room.</p>

<p>Then Cora spoke to Arthur, and he, after a few
minutes&#8217; earnest conversation with her, sauntered
across the room to Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the Van Santens are
rather surprised to see you here to-day. They had
an idea, I think, that you took the part of Sir William
Gurdon against them.&#8221;</p>

<p>By a rapid process of thought, Gerard knew how
this idea had arisen in their minds. He had left the
Priory by himself on the preceding Sunday, and had
only met Sir William afterwards. As he had expressed
no opinion favorable to Sir William&#8217;s cause
previous to that, but as he had, on the contrary, done
his best to persuade the baronet that he had made a
mistake, it was clear that Cora&#8217;s idea could not be
based on what she had then seen and heard.</p>

<p>It was because Denver had followed Sir William,
having injured the tire of his car in order to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
him to a standstill, and because he had then discovered
Gerard in the baronet&#8217;s company, and the
family understood him to be on the side of the
enemy.</p>

<p>He was careful, however, to give no hint of what
he knew to Arthur when he was thus accused of siding
with the baronet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surprised to see me, are they?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Do
you mean that they wish me to withdraw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, oh no, of course not,&#8221; said Arthur
hastily. &#8220;But they want to understand how it is
that you have changed your mind about that? And
whether you have seen Sir William since?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard perceived that Cora had sent her obedient
slave, Arthur, to try to &#8220;pump&#8221; him as to his
position and intentions. It was part of the general
uneasiness that he had noticed that they wanted to
know precisely the attitude taken up by each of their
visitors. And Gerard knew that he was especially
under observation, on account of his known admiration
for Miss Davison and Denver&#8217;s possible jealousy,
as well as because he was now known to have been the
cause of the miscarriage of Denver&#8217;s projected attack
upon Sir William.</p>

<p>Although neither he nor the baronet could have
sworn to the identity of the figure, which had
shadowed them and which they had then pursued, with
Denver Van Santen, or of the fact that he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
armed, there was very little doubt in the minds of
either upon those points.</p>

<p>Knowing that his answer would be faithfully reported,
Gerard answered with caution&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen Sir William! Oh yes, I went up to town
with him last Sunday. We started in his car, but had
a breakdown and went back by train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you persuade him to think better of his
disgraceful conduct?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I persuaded him&mdash;or rather, I helped to persuade
him&mdash;to write an apology to Mrs. Van Santen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you quite see that he made a fool of himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think his conduct was very wise,&#8221; he admitted
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or that he was justified in bringing such an accusation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, if he thought what he did, it would have
been better to talk things over with his own friends
before making a scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>This answer was not at all what Arthur wanted.
It made him uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you don&#8217;t think there was anything in it?
I can&#8217;t think you would be here to-day if you had
thought there was!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we needn&#8217;t discuss that now. It&#8217;s a subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
we should be bound to get warm over, whatever
we thought, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said he soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly makes me warm to hear a doubt cast
upon my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt has been cast on anybody by me,&#8221; replied
Gerard quickly. &#8220;If they want to know, you
can tell them so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur went away, evidently not quite satisfied,
and Gerard strolled through the adjoining room into
the card-room at the end of the suite.</p>

<p>There had been changes in the position of affairs
during the short interval since he left Miss Davison
conversing with Denver in the middle room.</p>

<p>Rachel herself had disappeared, and he learned
from Delia, who, in the course of her pacifying errands,
met him and asked him whether he was going
to play bridge, that she had gone upstairs with a
headache.</p>

<p>This statement was received by Gerard with certain
vague suspicions.</p>

<p>He entered the card-room, and found play in full
swing at four different tables. As usual, Harry
Van Santen was playing bridge, and Denver was
having his usual luck at poker.</p>

<p>The table at which he sat was the nearest to the
door communicating with the adjoining room, and
it was also the nearest to the window, which was
closed and hidden behind the drawn curtains.</p>

<p>Cecil Jones formed one of the poker party, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
he was being eased of the money of which he had
boasted.</p>

<p>But Gerard, who had now had time to consider
his face well, was surprised to note in his usually
sheepish face something which made him quite sure
that there was some mystery about this friend of
Miss Davison&#8217;s. He had suspected it before, but he
was now sure of it. Not only was there under his
expression of surface silliness an occasional look which
showed intelligence of a quite unusual kind, but there
was to-day in his manner a certain quiet watchfulness,
which made Gerard think he was lying in wait for
something.</p>

<p>What that something was&mdash;whether a signal from
one of the Van Santens, or a scene, or a signal from
somebody else and another sort of scene&mdash;he could
not be sure. But that there was trouble of some
kind in the air he knew quite well.</p>

<p>He almost thought, indeed, as he watched Cecil
Jones from the doorway, and saw him losing his
money with little silly exclamations of impatience or
surprise, that the man appeared to be listening for
something.</p>

<p>Once or twice he glanced in the direction of the
window, although, as it was closed and curtained, he
could see nothing whatever of it.</p>

<p>He lost more and more heavily as time went on,
and bore his losses with wonderful equanimity.</p>

<p>But when play had gone on for some time, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
while he was being steadily eased of his money,
Gerard heard a soft rustling sound behind him, and
turning quickly saw that old Mrs. Van Santen was
standing at his elbow, with a look of indescribable
terror and distress upon her face. It seemed to him
that she was watching Cecil Jones as if he had been,
not the innocent idiot he looked, or the confederate
which Gerard had till that day believed him to be
of her sons, but some harbinger of evil, some messenger
of adverse fate.</p>

<p>And in a moment the last rag of suspicion that
Jones could be a decoy and a partner in the Van Santen
operations fled from Gerard&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>The game went on, meanwhile, although it seemed
to him that the old lady would fain have stopped
it. She even made an attempt to catch Denver&#8217;s eye,
and partially succeeded at last. But he only made
her an abrupt sign to withdraw, and went on with the
congenial task of winning from the placid Jones the
money which he had so openly boasted of having
brought with him.</p>

<p>At a sign from her son, Mrs. Van Santen suddenly
disappeared, and Gerard saw her no more for some
time, and wondered whether she had retired to &#8220;have
a good cry&#8221; over her son&#8217;s gambling propensities,
and the troubles which she perhaps foresaw for him
in consequence.</p>

<p>Gerard, who was quite sure in his own mind that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Cecil Jones was being robbed, and that he was aware
of the fact, found himself growing more and more
excited, as he waited, in a state of extreme nerve-tension,
for the crisis which he felt must be approaching.</p>

<p>The sounds of voices, of movements, became dull
and confused in his mind; the figures of the players
became blurred, and a sort of singing in his ears
warned him that he had better find relief to his intense
excitement in the open air, when suddenly, just
as he was turning to go towards the French window
of the middle room, there was a sound like the hissing
of a serpent, followed immediately by the overthrow
of half a dozen chairs, and turning, he saw that, as
he had foreseen, the crisis had come.</p>

<p>Cecil Jones, leaning across the card-table, had
seized Denver&#8217;s arm, and dragged out from the sleeve
of the American a card, which he flung down, face
upwards, upon the table.</p>

<p>Leaning across the table, and looking up steadily
into the face of the baffled Denver, who had sprung
up from his chair, and was standing, still in the grip
of Jones, pale with rage and discomfiture, Jones said,
in a quiet voice that carried clearly to every corner of
the room and into that beyond&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so. You are a card-sharper!&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant there was an uproar in the room.</p>

<p>The men who had been playing at the same table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
with Denver and Jones were on their feet already,
exclaiming, protesting, uttering indignant exclamations.</p>

<p>There was now a rush from the other tables, and
Harry Van Santen led the crowd that gathered round
the detected cheat.</p>

<p>Harry, with a very white face, uttered a harsh
laugh which was meant to be reassuring, but which
was hollow, hideous, unreal, and horrible to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s a trick, a silly
trick that some of you have played upon my brother!
Who is it? You, Jones? Come, speak up and own
to it like a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard as was his forced laughter, the manner of the
older American was so assured, his voice was so deep
and so confident, that one or two of the men present
seemed at first inclined to believe that the version of
the affair which he was trying to maintain was the
true one.</p>

<p>But Cecil Jones suddenly sprang up from his
sprawling attitude, and stood erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, addressing, conspicuously,
not the two Americans, but the rest of the company,
&#8220;there has been systematic cheating carried on here,
as some of you might have guessed, I should think.
Don&#8217;t be alarmed. There is nothing to be feared
except by the men who have robbed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The uproar of voices, excited, indignant, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
had ceased when he began to speak, rose again when
he left off.</p>

<p>In the midst of it, there was a shrill scream, and
Mrs. Van Santen, looking, not the dear, simple old
lady they were all used to, but a very virago, with
flaming eyes and harsh voice, cried, addressing Harry
and Denver&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get away. The house is surrounded!&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Something</span> in the altered appearance of Mrs. Van
Santen, as she came in with resolute air and addressed
her sons in a harsh, strident voice, revealed
to Gerard, as by a flash of inspiration, some of the
truth respecting her.</p>

<p>That is to say, he recognized that he had been deceived
in her; that the gentle, amiable, simple old lady,
with her primitive dress and air of surprise at her
new surroundings was a fraud; that, far from being
the innocent old lady she appeared to be, grateful for
the recognition of her smart English friends, and
amazed at the position in which she found herself in
that English society which she had been taught to
consider stiff and exclusive, Mrs. Van Santen was in
truth a very keen-eyed woman, who understood
thoroughly that British idiosyncrasy of being exclusive
to its own countrymen, but over-ready to receive
foreigners at their own valuation; that she had been
quick to avail herself of it, and to do all in her power
to assist her family towards a good position in English
society, by a very clever affectation of humility
and simplicity combined, which had disarmed while it
charmed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>The old woman advanced into the card-room, and,
looking around her with eyes which were keen and
sharp and penetrating, said, in an undertone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that Davison girl? I believe it&#8217;s she who
is at the bottom of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the turmoil which had succeeded to the dead
silence with which her first announcement that the
house was surrounded was received, Mrs. Van Santen
was the coolest person in the room.</p>

<p>Denver had leaped to the window with an oath,
had looked out into the garden from the shelter of
the curtains, and had drawn back again, with his
fresh color gone, and the look of a hunted animal in
his handsome eyes.</p>

<p>Harry, on the other hand, had begun to busy himself
in hastily collecting not only the cards which were
lying on the table, but the money as well. In this
latter occupation, however, he was stopped by Cecil
Jones, who, having kept a keen eye on all that happened
after his first unmasking of Denver, noted
Harry&#8217;s occupation, and at once checked him in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better leave the stakes alone,&#8221; said he
quietly. &#8220;They are not yours, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Van Santen showed fewer signs of emotion
than his brother had done. On being thus challenged,
he just shrugged his shoulders, raised his eyebrows,
and withdrawing from the group that was clamoring
round the tables, sat down in a corner, with his face
to the back of his chair, and leaned down upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
arms, biting his nails and keeping his eyes down.</p>

<p>It flashed through Gerard&#8217;s mind as he looked at
him that he must have been through similar scenes
before, that he knew it was best to take things quietly,
and to lie in wait for a chance to escape.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Denver was blustering, assuring his
guests that there was no need to be uneasy, that an
ugly trick was being played upon them, and that, if
the ladies would retire, he and the other men would
find out who were the authors of this fresh outrage,
and would soon set matters right.</p>

<p>Of this advice, however, no notice was taken.
There were several ladies present, but they were all
what Denver himself irreverently spoke of as &#8220;old
stagers,&#8221; women of rank or social position established
enough not to be daunted by the prospect of another
&#8220;row,&#8221; and old enough to know that the quieter they
were the better were their own chances of getting out
of the ugly affair with dignity.</p>

<p>All, moreover, were curious as to the issue of this
business; and though one lady affected to be on the
verge of hysterics, as nobody was at leisure to take
any notice of her, she speedily recovered sufficiently
to take the same interest as the rest in what was going
on.</p>

<p>For events now began to move fast.</p>

<p>Someone said &#8220;Hush!&#8221; and then all became aware
that there were voices and footsteps to be heard outside
the house. One man went behind the curtains to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
look out, and came back with a serious expression of
face, to confirm Mrs. Van Santen&#8217;s sensational statement.</p>

<p>The house <i>was</i> surrounded, and they were all
virtually in custody.</p>

<p>Not one of the people assembled, with the exception
of old Mrs. Van Santen, made an attempt to
leave the room. She crossed the room with amazing
rapidity for one of her years, but finding that someone
had locked the door, she turned back again, and
stood with a fierce look on her face, but without speaking,
with her back to the door, watching for the
crisis.</p>

<p>Then there was a rattle and a rush in the next
room, and a female voice, which they believed to be
Cora&#8217;s, uttered a slight scream.</p>

<p>Then two policemen in uniform came into the room,
and the foremost came up to the table and looked
round.</p>

<p>Before he could speak, Cecil Jones, from the opposite
side of the table, addressed him&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are five of them,&#8221; he said, &#8220;two men and
three women. Three out of the five are in this room,
the other two are, I believe, in those two rooms adjoining,&#8221;
and he pointed to the other drawing-rooms.
&#8220;These are the two men.&#8221; He pointedly rapidly to
Denver and Harry Van Santen, and then, turning, indicated
Mrs. Van Santen, as he added: &#8220;And this is
the head of them all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>While he was speaking three or four more men had
come quietly into the room, and by the time he had
ended, both Denver and Harry Van Santen found
themselves practically prisoners, each having a constable
in uniform on either side of him.</p>

<p>Cecil Jones&#8217;s concluding words had created a sort
of subdued hubbub in the room. The amazement with
which the onlookers learned that the dear old lady,
whom they had all condescendingly pitied and rather
liked, was the head of a gang of swindlers caused
a new and strange excitement to ferment in the
room.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, they looked at Mrs.
Van Santen, and were shocked to see in her usually
mild eyes the ferocity of a wild beast at bay, as two
constables came up to her, and, without attempting to
touch her, kept her between them and stood on the
watch one on each side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Van Santen! Isn&#8217;t it a mistake?&#8221; whispered
some of the ladies present. But the voice of Cecil
Jones cut short the whispers.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Catherine Burge, the woman who did
fourteen years for insurance frauds,&#8221; was the answer
which Jones gave to a man who was remonstrating
against the indignity offered to the old lady.</p>

<p>A murmur of dismay ran through the room, and
passed on to the next, where all the rest of the guests
were congregated in an eager group close to the door
of the card-room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>Arthur was in the middle of this group, and beside
him was Cora Van Santen, the woman whom he looked
upon as the loveliest and sweetest in the world.</p>

<p>Cora was deathly pale, and her teeth were tightly
set and her slender hands were clenched; but she had
not said one word after the scream she had given when
the police entered the house.</p>

<p>Now, however, she suddenly asked a question. As
half a dozen more constables came in single file into
the room in which she was, entering by way of the
French window, and at once taking up a position behind
the group in the doorway, she said to Arthur,
in a fierce undertone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who let them in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Arthur, who felt sick and cold
with excitement and the dread of hearing something
which would reflect upon the woman he admired.</p>

<p>Delia, who was also in the group, and who heard
these words asked and answered, turned round and
laughed harshly. She was looking altogether different
from the charming, tactful, gracious creature who
usually spent her time walking from one to another
among the guests, smoothing the rough places and
making herself popular with everyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess?&#8221; was all she said.</p>

<p>And then she turned her head disdainfully away
again, and resumed her strenuous watch of the proceedings
in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>By this time Cecil Jones had seen his orders carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
out in the card-room, had muttered a low-voiced
apology to one of the guests, a sporting man of some
social standing, whom he recognized, and had then
advanced towards the group in the doorway. Looking
carefully among them, he said, addressing the
constables who were standing behind them&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two more here. That&#8217;s one of them,&#8221;
and he glanced at Delia. &#8220;And&#8221;&mdash;he turned again,&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s
the fifth and the last,&#8221; and he indicated
Cora.</p>

<p>Arthur was up in arms. Struck with consternation,
he saw a constable beckoning to Cora to come out of
the crowd which surrounded her. The girl, with a
frightened scream, which contrasted strongly with the
calmness shown by the others, tried to hide herself
among the crowd. Arthur at once tried to place
himself between her and the police, so that she might
make her escape, as she appeared to wish to do, into
the card-room.</p>

<p>But Cecil Jones was confronting her, and he smiled,
and said gently&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s of no use, Mr. Aldington. You&#8217;d better advise
the young lady to take things quietly. Especially
as we shall do her but little harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora, however, instead of profiting by this advice,
began to weep so violently, to utter so many hysterical
protests that she &#8220;had had nothing to do with
it, nothing whatever, that they told her it would be
all right, and that they ought to confess it now,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
that Cecil Jones made a sign to two of the constables,
who gently made their way through the group of
guests, and taking the weeping girl by the arms, led
her back into the middle room, with Arthur Aldington,
protesting indignantly, in close attendance.</p>

<p>When once she was free from the pressure of the
crowd, however, Cora suddenly resisted the attempts
which they were about to make to lay her on the sofa,
and springing upright, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me go I&#8217;ll tell you everything I
know. It isn&#8217;t really very much, and I&#8217;m real sorry
now I ever took up with these people. My engagement
was to sing, that&#8217;s all: one hundred and fifty
dollars a day, and expenses. And I was to know
nothing. Well, and I don&#8217;t know anything, except
that the police have come in. Now you&#8217;ll let me go,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ll be detained long, miss,&#8221;
said one of the men. &#8220;But as your name has been
given us with the rest, we&#8217;re bound to take you before
the magistrate with them. It won&#8217;t be more than a
formal business as far as you&#8217;re concerned, I daresay,
if you can prove what you&#8217;ve told us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to be taken off as if I were a
criminal,&#8221; said Cora plaintively. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me be answerable for the lady&#8217;s appearance
at any time you may want her,&#8221; said Arthur quickly.</p>

<p>But the ungrateful Cora turned upon him and
stamped her foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not have you answerable
for me. I&#8217;d rather go through it myself. I&#8217;ve
had to be civil to everybody so long that now I must
just speak out and freely say what&#8217;s in my mind.
Mr. Aldington, you&#8217;re a fool. You might have
known how things were going, as your friend Buckland
did. He&#8217;s made himself safe, and I respect him
for it. He&#8217;s taken care to be on the right side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur was stupefied by this rebuff. Retreating
with a few muttered words, neither very coherent nor
very intelligible, he turned and met Delia who had
made no attempt to resist the constables, and who
stood erect between two of them, with an air of boredom
upon her handsome face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will they do with us?&#8221; she asked Arthur
quite simply. &#8220;Will we get the same as those men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean your brothers?&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced behind her with an air of superb
disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers?&#8221; she echoed, with much scorn.
&#8220;Those fellows our brothers? No. And we aren&#8217;t
sisters, either, or daughters to that old woman.
We&#8217;re each on our own. And there&#8217;s no credit in
owning it, as I guess you folks know all about us, as
much as we know ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur was astounded.</p>

<p>She smiled at him scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve had a good time!&#8221; she said at last,
in a half-regretful tone. &#8220;You Britishers are mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
easy to gull, aren&#8217;t you? One has only got to call
oneself a millionaire, to speak with an accent that
wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated on our side, and to give one&#8217;s
address as Chicago, and the best of you are ready to
open your arms&mdash;and your pockets. So, if you&#8217;re
taken in now and then, it&#8217;s not surprising.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;aren&#8217;t you&mdash;anything to do with&mdash;the
millionaire?&#8221; gasped Arthur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wish we were!&#8221; replied Delia simply; &#8220;no
such luck. We&#8217;re just a mixed lot of adventurers
and adventuresses, making a common cause to ease the
pockets of your silly society folk, and to get ourselves
a pleasant time. If it had only lasted a little longer,&#8221;
she added, with a sigh, &#8220;we&#8217;d each have landed a stockbroker
or one of your wooden-headed baronets, and
then we&#8217;d have been fixed up to rights!&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur turned slowly to look at Cora. She had
dried her eyes, and was sitting rather disconsolately on
the sofa, while the constables who had charge of both
these younger ladies remained at a moderate distance,
satisfied that they had them both under observation.</p>

<p>A moment later, there was a movement in the group
round the door which led to the card-room, and Mrs.
Van Santen, closely guarded by two constables, came
in. At the sight of the two girls, she ran forward
and would have thrown herself on Delia&#8217;s neck, with
a smothered sob and a cry of &#8220;My daughter!&#8221; but
Delia avoided her embrace and said shortly&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve had enough of this. We&#8217;re going to
tell the truth, all that we know. Our contract&#8217;s ended
now, and we must save ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Santen at once became a changed woman.
The sweet look of tenderness with which she had flown
towards Delia altered to a hard expression of anger
and resentment, as she stopped short and putting her
head on one side, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, have you given us all away, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Delia shortly. &#8220;You have to
thank those two card-sharpers in there for doing
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean my sons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you haven&#8217;t any sons,&#8221; retorted Delia, who
seemed to take a sort of calm delight in making her
confession as complete and as public as possible.
&#8220;Those two men whom you call your sons are no
more children of yours than they are brothers of ours.
They&#8217;re just a pair of swindlers who don&#8217;t know how
to swindle without being found out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made this statement calmly, in a high, clear
voice, not without a rather cleverly devised intention
of being heard and applauded by the people present,
including the police.</p>

<p>She was old enough to know that her share and that
of the singing girl Cora, having been entirely passive
and showy, rather than actively useful in the swindling
practices carried on by their male confederates,
the punishment in store for them could not be on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
same plane as that earned by the men themselves.</p>

<p>And as for Mrs. Van Santen, why, she was old
enough and experienced enough to look out for herself.</p>

<p>But this sudden change in the attitude of her
adopted family seemed for a time to disconcert the
old woman, who stared from Delia to Cora and back
again with an air of uncertainty as to what course
she should pursue in the circumstances. Before long,
however, she recovered herself, and, turning to the
policeman who walked beside her and who appeared
more vigilant than those who were looking after the
younger women, she said, in a hard voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got to prove that there&#8217;s anything
wrong in adopting and providing for three or four
young creatures who are not your own children by
birth; and that&#8217;s the worst thing you can accuse me
of, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody has accused you of anything, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
said one of the officers. &#8220;And you&#8217;d best not say
anything more, else it may be used against you presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Van Santen, alias Catherine Burge,
laughed in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had
some dealings with your sort before, as some of you
know. I don&#8217;t deny it. But that has nothing to
do with my conduct now, and I tell you there&#8217;s nothing
to be proved against me but too large a heart.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am, you confine yourself to proving
that when you&#8217;re before the magistrates, and you
won&#8217;t come to much harm if you succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in spite of the purity of her intentions, the
old lady did not look quite satisfied on this point.
And Gerard Buckland, when he came out of the card-room
a minute later in search of Miss Davison, saw
that his gentle old New Englander had been transformed
into a hard-featured virago who glared at
him with a suspicious eye.</p>

<p>The sight of him roused the savage slumbering in
her breast. She even made a half attempt to rush
towards him, but a movement on the part of the nearest
policeman made her pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know who you&#8217;re looking for, Mr. Gerard Buckland,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;And I wish I knew myself where
to find her. She&#8217;d not leave this house with her
demure face unscratched if I could!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard, who had begun to make a shrewd guess as
to the reason of Miss Davison&#8217;s disappearance, knew
better than to attempt to dispute with the angry
woman.</p>

<p>He looked at Arthur Aldington, with a questioning
upraising of the eyebrows, which the other rightly
understood to be an invitation to accompany him on
his departure.</p>

<p>Arthur, still unwilling to leave Cora, who meanwhile
had ungratefully turned her back upon him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
was sitting close to Delia on the sofa, talking to her
in a low voice, coughed to attract the attention of
the girl who had enchanted him.</p>

<p>Cora looked carelessly over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anything I can do for you?&#8221; he asked
in a low, hoarse voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing whatever, thank you,&#8221; she replied coldly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done with all of you. I&#8217;ve had to be civil long
enough; now I can be natural, and&mdash;good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held out her hand quite abruptly and coldly.</p>

<p>He took it, held it for a moment in fingers that
trembled, and then, dropping it with just one reproachful
look at her, would almost have staggered
as he went away, but for Gerard, who took him by
the arm, and led him to the inner door.</p>

<p>It was locked.</p>

<p>&#8220;May we go out?&#8221; asked Gerard of the nearest
policeman.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and the man went into the next
room to consult Cecil Jones, came back with the key
of the door, opened it, and silently let the two young
men into the hall.</p>

<p>Here a couple of frightened maid-servants and a
sullen footman were sitting on the stairs, discussing
the amazing situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Miss Davison gone away?&#8221; asked Gerard of
one of them.</p>

<p>But she only shook her head, and, looking horribly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
alarmed, told him that she knew nothing, and that
they had been warned not to say anything to anybody
except the police.</p>

<p>With which discomfiting information the two young
men had to be content, as they went out of the Priory
for the last time.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV, AND LAST</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> walked in silence down the drive, with that sinking
of the heart inevitable when a pleasant time comes
suddenly to an end. But there was more than this to
trouble them both. The thoughts of the young men
were with the girls who had enchanted them. Arthur
was pondering, with the deepest pain, the terrible
awakening he had had only a short time before, from
the dream that he had found a pearl among women,
a very queen of girls.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to take courage, and to
ask Cora to be his wife, although he was afraid that
his own prospects, good as they were, might not
seem golden enough to tempt the parents of the sweet-voiced
Cora to yield their consent to his wooing.</p>

<p>But of Cora herself he had entertained no doubts.
And to find that the charms which had fascinated him,
the bright wit which had amused him, had been merely
part of the stock-in-trade of one of a party of adventurers,
bent on making a good thing out of British
credulity while their time of prosperity lasted, was
such a shock that it left him dazed, unable to think or
to understand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Gerard, on his side, though he was not suffering,
like his friend, from a great disillusion, was in a state
of terrible anxiety.</p>

<p>Where was Rachel? Had she compromised herself
with these adventurers? And had she alone of them
all had the cleverness to escape the net laid for their
feet by the police?</p>

<p>Or was she, as he thought much more probable, the
accomplice of Cecil Jones, and his assistant in bringing
the Americans to justice?</p>

<p>Neither possibility was pleasant to contemplate.
If she were one of the friends of these Americans,
even though she might extricate herself from all suspicion
of being concerned in their misdoings, she
could not fail to be dragged into a most unpleasant
case, the publicity of which might perhaps offend, if
not alienate, her best friends.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, as seemed much more probable,
she should prove to have been the accomplice
of Cecil Jones, it was distasteful to contemplate her
having assisted in exposing the people who passed as
her friends and who gave her the shelter of their
roof.</p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, it was in a state of considerable
perplexity and distress that Gerard accompanied
his friend down the drive, and turned into the
road.</p>

<p>Both young men had come down by train, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
was towards the station that they were wending their
way, when they saw a little way in front of them the
bright lights of a motor-car.</p>

<p>Expecting to find that it and its occupants had
some connection with the police surprise at the Priory,
Gerard and Arthur walked quickly up to it and perceived
that the man in a big overcoat, who was standing
beside it, was no other than Cecil Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, making a gesture with his hand
to stop them, &#8220;here he comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young men, rather disconcerted, stopped and
looked at him aggressively. They felt that upon his
shoulders lay the burden of the brusque manner in
which the crisis at the Priory had taken place.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are from Scotland Yard, I suppose?&#8221; said
Gerard stiffly.</p>

<p>Jones nodded with a genial smile. But it was
strange how that smile of his, which used to seem so
imbecile and irritating when they had taken him for a
fool, or an amiable decoy, seemed to have grown
astute and intelligent now that they knew him for
what he was, a detective of remarkably well developed
histrionic powers and the keenest of keen eyes.</p>

<p>Jones nodded.</p>

<p>Gerard glanced at the car, and Jones stepped
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s someone you know inside,&#8221; he said with
a dry smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>He was gently, mildly triumphant, satisfied with
having brought off a coup which would redound
greatly to his credit.</p>

<p>Gerard guessed whom he should see as he stepped
up to the side of the car. And, just as he had expected,
he saw Miss Davison inside, leaning back in
one corner, with her eyes closed, and a look of weariness
that was almost pain upon her handsome, pale
face.</p>

<p>But it was the sight of the man seated beside her
which caused Gerard to utter an exclamation, and to
look in stupefaction from Rachel to him and from
him to Cecil Jones.</p>

<p>For, sitting in the car beside Miss Davison, wrapped
in a fur-lined motor-coat and with a cap drawn well
down over his eyes, was the distinguished-looking
man with the white mustache whom Gerard had been
accustomed to look upon as her evil genius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me introduce Mr. Buckland, Colonel,&#8221; said
Cecil Jones, as he came up to the side of the car and
leaned upon the door.</p>

<p>But at the name Miss Davison sat up, and leaning
towards the man by her side, whispered loud enough
for Gerard to hear&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, uncle, I may tell him now, may I not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Some inkling of the truth, the whole truth, was already
beginning to glimmer in Gerard&#8217;s brain, but he
was not to know all just yet.</p>

<p>The man with the white mustache shook his head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
whispered something back, and then said aloud, holding
out his hand to Gerard&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased to meet you, Mr. Buckland.
I&#8217;ve heard a great deal about you from my niece.
But I ought to introduce myself. My name is
Ormsby, Colonel Ormsby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard could scarcely refrain from uttering a cry.
For he had suddenly remembered that the face of the
man with the white mustache, which had roused faint
recollections which he could not fix in his mind, was
that of a certain gallant officer who had been made
chief constable of one of the large provincial towns,
and who had distinguished himself not many years before
in an important criminal case which was still in
the public mind.</p>

<p>Further glimmerings as to Miss Davison&#8217;s position
began to appear in Gerard&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cecil Jones had said a few words in a
low voice to the colonel, and raising his hat to the
lady, had walked back towards the Priory at a brisk
pace, accompanied by another man who had remained
quietly in the background during the few minutes that
this introduction lasted.</p>

<p>The colonel asked the two young men whether they
would go back to town, and on receiving their thanks,
he made way for them to enter the car, which immediately
started on its journey.</p>

<p>Very little was said by anybody until town was
reached.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>Miss Davison, who seemed thoroughly exhausted,
scarcely opened her eyes, but sat back in her corner,
from time to time inhaling the contents of a bottle
of lavender salts which she held in her hand.</p>

<p>The colonel sat next to her, and Gerard on the
outer side, while Arthur Aldington occupied the seat
beside the driver.</p>

<p>It was a very long time before Colonel Ormsby
said anything about the affair at the Priory. But
just as they were driving through the outskirts of
London, and Miss Davison was rousing herself and
putting up her hands to rearrange her hat, he whispered
in the young man&#8217;s ear&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been present to-day at the capture of one
of the most dangerous card-sharping and blackmailing
gangs in Europe. They&#8217;ll each get seven
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blackmailing?&#8221; echoed Gerard, horrorstruck.</p>

<p>The colonel nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They hadn&#8217;t begun that game over here yet, but
they wouldn&#8217;t have been long in starting, if they
hadn&#8217;t been laid by the heels. That old woman is
the author of more mischief than would suffice to keep
half a dozen criminal courts busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the name&mdash;isn&#8217;t she Mrs. Van Santen?&#8221; he
asked appalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. There is a Mrs. Van Santen, who lives in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
out-of-the-way town in the States, and whose husband
has made his pile in railway stocks; but she has nothing
to do with them, nor have the other members
of the gang. Each has a different surname or,
rather, a dozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the women&mdash;the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything of the one who calls herself
Delia; but there is probably a history behind her
good-looking mask. The other is a public singer&mdash;married&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married?&#8221; echoed Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;husband in America, or was. She may
now be the wife of the man who calls himself Harry
Van Santen. He&#8217;s a precious scoundrel, the worse of
the two, if anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was appalled. The thought that Miss
Davison had been living under the same roof with
these dangerous criminals was terrible, and he stammered
out something of his thoughts.</p>

<p>The colonel glanced at him quickly, and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a woman of the finest pluck and the most
indomitable spirit could have done it. The strain
must have been tremendous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However,
we couldn&#8217;t have brought things to a head without her
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To play the spy&mdash;on the people who thought
she was their friend!&#8221; stammered Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not exactly the case,&#8221; returned the colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
in a voice too low for his niece to hear. &#8220;She helped
to keep the house going. I know, for we supplied the
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>Then he sat back as if stunned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she is&mdash;a detective!&#8221; he almost gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she has been acting in that capacity,&#8221; admitted
Colonel Ormsby. &#8220;I wish she would go on
with the career. She began it at my suggestion, on
my fervent advice. She has been a great success, an
unparalleled success. If you were wise, you, as I understand,
have great influence with her, would advise
her to keep on with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard said nothing. He did not see the look of
keen anxiety on the face of Rachel, who had gathered
some part of their conversation, and who knew what
the subject was that they were discussing.</p>

<p>They went on in silence until Piccadilly was reached.
Then the colonel turned to his niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, where are you going to stay to-night?
Will you put up at my hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept on the lodgings in Duke Street,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go there. And you can come and
see me in the morning, and take me to Lady Jennings&#8217;.
I can&#8217;t feel happy till I&#8217;ve told the dear old thing
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, my dear. Then I&#8217;ll tell Marks to
drive to Duke Street.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>They drove on, and Miss Davison was helped out
by the gentlemen, and Gerard thanked the colonel for
having brought him so far on his way, and let the
car drive away without him.</p>

<p>For Miss Davison had given him a look which he
took for permission to speak to her. And as the car
drove down the street, they walked up it, side by side,
in the quiet night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said she, with a weary air of being glad
to get rid of a burden, &#8220;you know everything. You
can see why it was impossible for me to tell you anything.
I was under promise&mdash;oath&mdash;not to let any
creature on earth know what I was and what my work
was. I was fully sheltered by the fact that it was
my uncle who had started me on this most distasteful
but most remunerative career, and though I have often
asked him to release me, he has always refused until
I could assist in carrying out some sensational feat, to
justify, as he said, his choice of me for this career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he has released you now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. If he had not, you would have known
nothing, you would have been told nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have trusted me,&#8221; said Gerard reproachfully.</p>

<p>She turned upon him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could trust no one,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A word, nay,
a look, while I was living under the same roof with a
gang of dangerous criminals, might have been death
to me. I knew that, while I was staying with them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
I carried my life in my hand. It was by far the
worst experience I have ever had, and I could not have
gone through with it, could not have stood the strain
of being always on the watch for the proofs which I
had to hoard up to communicate to the police, but for
my uncle&#8217;s promise that it should be the last, the very
last thing he would call upon me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard involuntarily heaved a deep sigh of thankfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have done with it?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone grew harder.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the time, that is, of course. You will probably
find your way back when you are asked by the
friends you have formed. It was Cecil Jones who accompanied
you everywhere, wasn&#8217;t it? When you
detected pickpockets in a crowd, and handed him the
stolen property? When you accompanied him to
the police-station to give evidence against the shop-lifter
at the stores&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought <i>I</i> was the shop-lifter!&#8221; said Miss
Davison demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know better now. As I say, you always
had this Jones&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose name is not Jones at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you had this fellow who calls himself Jones
to help you and to stand by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. My uncle, who gives advice to the police
in important cases still, though he has practically retired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
picked out this man as one he could rely upon
to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I suppose you will marry him?&#8221; said
Gerard fiercely.</p>

<p>Miss Davison looked demurely down on the pavement.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a wife,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and three, if not four,
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davison suddenly stopped and held out her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said she, &#8220;Mr. Buckland, and&mdash;good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it in his own, which was
trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must it be good-bye, Rachel?&#8221; he said
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said she, with a little forced, weary
laugh, &#8220;you don&#8217;t want to remain a friend of an ex-detective!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard burst into a tirade of which the salient
features were that he would have remained her friend
if she had actually been one of the gang themselves,
if she had been a card-sharper, if she had been a shop-lifter,
if she had been a pickpocket. He loved her,
and he knew that, whatever she might have done, she
would never have been anything at heart but the noble
and good woman whom he loved as he had always
done.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>He behaved indeed so irrationally, he expressed his
love and devotion in so many impassioned and absurd
speeches, he looked so earnest and he spoke so tenderly,
that Miss Davison, if she could in any case have held
out till morning, was softened, and gave way there and
then. Gave way, that is to say, to the extent of telling
him that he was an absurd boy, and that he might,
if he liked, and if he had nothing better to do, take
her to see Lady Jennings on the following day.</p>

<p>And, as there was no one in the street, she let him
kiss her when he said good-night.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
